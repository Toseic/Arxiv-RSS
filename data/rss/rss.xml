   <title>CoServe: Efficient Collaboration-of-Experts (CoE) Model Inference with Limited Memory</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02354</link>
   <description>Large language models like GPT-4 are resource-intensive, but recent advancements suggest that smaller, specialized experts can outperform the monolithic models on specific tasks. The Collaboration-of-Experts (CoE) approach integrates multiple expert models, improving the accuracy of generated results and offering great potential for precision-critical applications, such as automatic circuit board quality inspection. However, deploying CoE serving systems presents challenges to memory capacity due to the large number of experts required, which can lead to significant performance overhead from frequent expert switching across different memory and storage tiers.
  We propose CoServe, an efficient CoE model serving system on heterogeneous CPU and GPU with limited memory. CoServe reduces unnecessary expert switching by leveraging expert dependency, a key property of CoE inference. CoServe introduces a dependency-aware request scheduler and dependency-aware expert management for efficient inference. It also introduces an offline profiler to automatically find optimal resource allocation on various processors and devices. In real-world intelligent manufacturing workloads, CoServe achieves 4.5$\times$ to 12$\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</description>

   <title>GIScience in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Research Agenda Towards Autonomous GIS</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23633</link>
   <description>The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. As we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we carry a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.</description>

   <title>A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803</link>
   <description>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations. SCARF is available at GitHub repository.</description>

   <title>VCR-Bench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07956</link>
   <description>The advancement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, a rigorous evaluation framework for video CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately assess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies in perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos spanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034 high-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a stepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association with the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven distinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT process based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on VCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the top-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7% accuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score lower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in temporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust positive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity of our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning in solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a standardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex video reasoning task.</description>

   <title>Interplay between Federated Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence: a Scoping Review</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05874</link>
   <description>The joint implementation of federated learning (FL) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) could allow training models from distributed data and explaining their inner workings while preserving essential aspects of privacy. Toward establishing the benefits and tensions associated with their interplay, this scoping review maps the publications that jointly deal with FL and XAI, focusing on publications that reported an interplay between FL and model interpretability or post-hoc explanations. Out of the 37 studies meeting our criteria, only one explicitly and quantitatively analyzed the influence of FL on model explanations, revealing a significant research gap. The aggregation of interpretability metrics across FL nodes created generalized global insights at the expense of node-specific patterns being diluted. Several studies proposed FL algorithms incorporating explanation methods to safeguard the learning process against defaulting or malicious nodes. Studies using established FL libraries or following reporting guidelines are a minority. More quantitative research and structured, transparent practices are needed to fully understand their mutual impact and under which conditions it happens.</description>

   <title>Traversal Learning Coordination For Lossless And Efficient Distributed Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07471</link>
   <description>In this paper, we introduce Traversal Learning (TL), a novel approach designed to address the problem of decreased quality encountered in popular distributed learning (DL) paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL), Split Learning (SL), and SplitFed Learning (SFL). Traditional FL experiences from an accuracy drop during aggregation due to its averaging function, while SL and SFL face increased loss due to the independent gradient updates on each split network. TL adopts a unique strategy where the model traverses the nodes during forward propagation (FP) and performs backward propagation (BP) on the orchestrator, effectively implementing centralized learning (CL) principles within a distributed environment. The orchestrator is tasked with generating virtual batches and planning the sequential node visits of the model during FP, aligning them with the ordered index of the data within these batches. We conducted experiments on six datasets representing diverse characteristics across various domains. Our evaluation demonstrates that TL is on par with classic CL approaches in terms of accurate inference, thereby offering a viable and robust solution for DL tasks. TL outperformed other DL methods and improved accuracy by 7.85% for independent and identically distributed (IID) datasets, macro F1-score by 1.06% for non-IID datasets, accuracy by 2.60% for text classification, and AUC by 3.88% and 4.54% for medical and financial datasets, respectively. By effectively preserving data privacy while maintaining performance, TL represents a significant advancement in DL methodologies.</description>

   <title>Efficient Heterogeneous Large Language Model Decoding with Model-Attention Disaggregation</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01814</link>
   <description>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in generative tasks but also introduce significant challenges in real-world serving due to inefficient use of the expensive, computation-optimized accelerators. Although disaggregated serving architectures have been proposed to split different phases of LLM inference, the efficiency of decoding phase is still low. This is caused by the varying resource demands of different operators in the transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, the attention operator is memory-intensive, exhibiting a memory access pattern that clashes with the strengths of modern accelerators, especially for long context requests. To enhance the efficiency of LLM decoding, we introduce model-attention disaggregation. This approach leverages a collection of cheap, memory-optimized devices for the attention operator while still utilizing high-end accelerators for other parts of the model. This heterogeneous setup ensures that each component is tailored to its specific workload, maximizing overall performance and cost efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments confirm the viability of splitting the attention computation over multiple devices. Also, the communication bandwidth required between heterogeneous devices proves to be manageable with prevalent networking technologies. To further validate our theory, we develop and deploy Lamina, an LLM inference system that incorporates model-attention disaggregation in a distributed heterogeneous cluster. Experimental results indicate that Lamina can provide 16.1 ~ 90.1% higher estimated throughput than existing solutions with similar costs.</description>

   <title>Achilles Heel of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07461</link>
   <description>Multi-agent system (MAS) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in addressing complex challenges, largely due to the integration of multiple large language models (LLMs). However, the heterogeneity of LLMs, the scalability of quantities of LLMs, and local computational constraints pose significant challenges to hosting these models locally. To address these issues, we propose a new framework termed Distributed Multi-Agent System (DMAS). In DMAS, heterogeneous third-party agents function as service providers managed remotely by a central MAS server and each agent offers its services through API interfaces. However, the distributed nature of DMAS introduces several concerns about trustworthiness. In this paper, we study the Achilles heel of distributed multi-agent systems, identifying four critical trustworthiness challenges: free riding, susceptibility to malicious attacks, communication inefficiencies, and system instability. Extensive experiments across seven frameworks and four datasets reveal significant vulnerabilities of the DMAS. These attack strategies can lead to a performance degradation of up to 80% and attain a 100% success rate in executing free riding and malicious attacks. We envision our work will serve as a useful red-teaming tool for evaluating future multi-agent systems and spark further research on trustworthiness challenges in distributed multi-agent systems.</description>

   <title>Apt-Serve: Adaptive Request Scheduling on Hybrid Cache for Scalable LLM Inference Serving</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07494</link>
   <description>Large language model (LLM) inference serving systems are essential to various LLM-based applications. As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling these systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical. However, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput, primarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO attainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1) memory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory constraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default First-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce Apt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM inference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines KV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state vectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on the hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism that dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive scheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and LLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up to 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art inference serving systems.</description>

Out of the 37 studies meeting our criteria, only one explicitly and quantitatively analyzed the influence of FL on model explanations, revealing a significant research gap. The aggregation of interpretability metrics across FL nodes created generalized global insights at the expense of node-specific patterns being diluted. Several studies proposed FL algorithms incorporating explanation methods to safeguard the learning process against defaulting or malicious nodes. Studies using established FL libraries or following reporting guidelines are a minority. More quantitative research and structured, transparent practices are needed to fully understand their mutual impact and under which conditions it happens.</description>

   <title>GIScience in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Research Agenda Towards Autonomous GIS</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23633</link>
   <description>The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. As we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we carry a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.</description>

   <title>Unified Generative Search and Recommendation</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730</link>
   <description>Modern commercial platforms typically offer both search and recommendation functionalities to serve diverse user needs, making joint modeling of these tasks an appealing direction. While prior work has shown that integrating search and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a performance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of the other. This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements: search emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas recommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items. Effectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1) integrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations, and (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of search and recommendation. The emergence of generative retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities. This paradigm encodes items as identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential generation tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and task-specific prompts. In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified generative framework for balanced search and recommendation. Our approach designs dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to incorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives. Experiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR effectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.</description>

   <title>Automating the Path: An R&amp;D Agenda for Human-Centered AI and Visualization</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07529</link>
   <description>The emergence of generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and foundation models is fundamentally reshaping computer science, and visualization and visual analytics are no exception. We present a systematic framework for understanding how human-centered AI (HCAI) can transform the visualization discipline. Our framework maps four key HCAI tool capabilities -- amplify, augment, empower, and enhance -- onto the four phases of visual sensemaking: view, explore, schematize, and report. For each combination, we review existing tools, envision future possibilities, identify challenges and pitfalls, and examine ethical considerations. This design space can serve as an R\&amp;D agenda for both visualization researchers and practitioners to integrate AI into their work as well as understanding how visualization can support HCAI research.</description>

   <title>DeepGreen: Effective LLM-Driven Green-washing Monitoring System Designed for Empirical Testing -- Evidence from China</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07733</link>
   <description>This paper proposes DeepGreen, an Large Language Model Driven (LLM-Driven) system for detecting corporate green-washing behaviour. Utilizing dual-layer LLM analysis, DeepGreen preliminarily identifies potential green keywords in financial statements and then assesses their implementation degree via iterative semantic analysis of LLM. A core variable GreenImplement is derived from the ratio from the two layers' output. We extract 204 financial statements of 68 companies from A-share market over three years, comprising 89,893 words, and analyse them through DeepGreen. Our analysis, supported by violin plots and K-means clustering, reveals insights and validates the variable against the Huazheng ESG rating. It offers a novel perspective for regulatory agencies and investors, serving as a proactive monitoring tool that complements traditional methods.Empirical tests show that green implementation can significantly boost the asset return rate of companies, but there is heterogeneity in scale. Small and medium-sized companies have limited contribution to asset return via green implementation, so there is a stronger motivation for green-washing.</description>

   <title>A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07803</link>
   <description>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations. SCARF is available at GitHub repository.</description>

   <title>VCR-Bench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07956</link>
   <description>The advancement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, a rigorous evaluation framework for video CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately assess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies in perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos spanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034 high-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a stepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association with the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven distinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT process based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on VCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the top-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7% accuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score lower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in temporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust positive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity of our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning in solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a standardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex video reasoning task.</description>
