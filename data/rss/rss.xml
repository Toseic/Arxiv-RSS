   <title>HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL: Optimizing LLM Inference Request Scheduling for Agentic Text-to-SQL Workflow</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05286</link>
   <description>Recent advances in leveraging the agentic paradigm of large language models (LLMs) utilization have significantly enhanced Text-to-SQL capabilities, enabling users without specialized database expertise to query data intuitively. However, deploying these agentic LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems in production poses substantial challenges due to their inherently multi-stage workflows, stringent latency constraints, and potentially heterogeneous GPU infrastructure in enterprise environments. Current LLM serving frameworks lack effective mechanisms for handling interdependent inference tasks, dynamic latency variability, and resource heterogeneity, leading to suboptimal performance and frequent service-level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL, a novel framework designed explicitly to schedule and execute agentic multi-stage LLM-based Text-to-SQL workflows on heterogeneous GPU clusters that handle multi-tenant end-to-end queries. HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL introduce a hierarchical scheduling approach combining global workload-balanced task dispatching and local adaptive urgency-guided prioritization, guided by a systematic analysis of agentic Text-to-SQL workflows. Additionally, we propose a lightweight simulation-based method for tuning critical scheduling hyperparameters, further enhancing robustness and adaptability. Our extensive evaluation on realistic Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrates that HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving frameworks. Specifically, HEXGEN-TEXT2SQL reduces latency deadlines by up to 1.67$\times$ (average: 1.41$\times$) and improves system throughput by up to 1.75$\times$ (average: 1.65$\times$) compared to vLLM under diverse, realistic workload conditions.

   <title>MARK: Memory Augmented Refinement of Knowledge</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05177</link>
   <description>Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid') and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory: Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role: Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension; LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory, detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy. Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference; Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets; Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.</description>

   <title>Federated Learning for Cyber Physical Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04873</link>
   <description>The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in this fast-paced and dynamic era.</description>

   <title>PlaceIt3D: Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05288</link>
   <description>We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</description>

   <title>ValuesRAG: Enhancing Cultural Alignment Through Retrieval-Augmented Contextual Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01031</link>
   <description>Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.</description>

   <title>Balancing Client Participation in Federated Learning Using AoI</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05099</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients. However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\%$ and up to $20\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning environments.</description>

   <title>FedRE: Robust and Effective Federated Learning with Privacy Preference</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04889</link>
   <description>Despite Federated Learning (FL) employing gradient aggregation at the server for distributed training to prevent the privacy leakage of raw data, private information can still be divulged through the analysis of uploaded gradients from clients. Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI), which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case, excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

   <title>FedTDP: A Privacy-Preserving and Unified Framework for Trajectory Data Preparation via Federated Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05155</link>
   <description>Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP) can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy, (ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii) propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on 6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

   <title>Federated EndoViT: Pretraining Vision Transformers via Federated Learning on Endoscopic Image Collections</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16612</link>
   <description>Purpose: In this study, we investigate the training of foundation models using federated learning to address data-sharing limitations and enable collaborative model training without data transfer for minimally invasive surgery. Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.</description>

   <title>Toward Reasonable Parrots: Why Large Language Models Should Argue with Us by Design</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05298</link>
   <description>In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.</description>

   <title>DFPL: Decentralized Federated Prototype Learning Across Heterogeneous Data Distributions</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04947</link>
   <description>Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that enables the collaborative training of multiple clients through centralized model aggregation. However, standard federated learning relies on a centralized server, making it vulnerable to server failures. While existing solutions utilize blockchain technology to implement Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), the statistical heterogeneity of data distributions among clients severely degrades the DFL's performance. Driven by this issue, this paper proposes a decentralized federated prototype learning framework, named DFPL, which significantly improves the performance of distributed machine learning across heterogeneous data distributions. Specifically, our framework introduces prototype learning into DFL to address statistical heterogeneity, which greatly reduces the number of parameters exchanged between clients. Additionally, blockchain is embedded into our framework, enabling the training and mining processes to be implemented at each client. From a theoretical perspective, we provide convergence guarantee of DFPL by combining resource allocation for training and mining. The experiments highlight the superiority of our DFPL framework in communication efficiency and test performance across three benchmark datasets with heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

   <title>CacheFL: Efficient Federated Cache Model Fine-Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05130</link>
   <description>Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have exhibited remarkable zero-shot performance across various image classification tasks. Fine-tuning these models on domain-specific datasets further enhances their effectiveness for downstream applications. However, fine-tuning in cloud environments raises significant concerns regarding data security and privacy. Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution by enabling model training across local clients without centralizing sensitive data, but the high communication and computation costs of transmitting full pre-trained models during training limit its scalability. Additionally, non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across local clients can negatively impact model convergence and performance. To address these challenges, we propose CacheFL, a novel federated learning method that replaces traditional full model fine-tuning with lightweight cache model fine-tuning. The cache model is initialized using a class-balanced dataset generated by a generative pre-trained model, effectively mitigating the impact of non-IID data. This cache model is then distributed to local clients for fine-tuning, and the updated parameters from each client are aggregated on the server and redistributed. With the updated cache model, the classification performance of CLIP is improved after just a few epochs. By limiting the training and communication to the cache model, CacheFL significantly reduces resource demands while ensuring data privacy and security. Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and 10 additional datasets demonstrate that CacheFL outperforms traditional approaches in terms of classification accuracy, resource efficiency, and privacy preservation.</description>

   <title>Federated Learning for Cyber Physical Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04873</link>
   <description>The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in this fast-paced and dynamic era.</description>

   <title>PPFPL: Cross-silo Privacy-preserving Federated Prototype Learning Against Data Poisoning Attacks on Non-IID Data</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03173</link>
   <description>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a deep learning model by submitting hidden model updates. Nonetheless, PPFL is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks due to the distributed training nature of clients. Existing solutions have struggled to improve the performance of cross-silo PPFL in poisoned Non-IID data. To address the issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated prototype learning framework, named PPFPL, which enhances the cross-silo FL performance in poisoned Non-IID data while effectively resisting data poisoning attacks. Specifically, we adopt prototypes as client-submitted model updates to eliminate the impact of tampered data distribution on federated learning. Moreover, we utilize two servers to achieve Byzantine-robust aggregation by secure aggregation protocol, which greatly reduces the impact of malicious clients. Theoretical analyses confirm the convergence of PPFPL, and experimental results on publicly available datasets show that PPFPL is effective for resisting data poisoning attacks with Non-IID conditions.</description>

   <title>Adaptive Biased User Scheduling for Heterogeneous Wireless Federate Learning Network</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05231</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) has revolutionized collaborative model training in distributed networks, prioritizing data privacy and communication efficiency. This paper investigates efficient deployment of FL in wireless heterogeneous networks, focusing on strategies to accelerate convergence despite stragglers. The primary objective is to minimize long-term convergence wall-clock time through optimized user scheduling and resource allocation. While stragglers may introduce delays in a single round, their inclusion can expedite subsequent rounds, particularly when they possess critical information. Moreover, balancing single-round duration with the number of cumulative rounds, compounded by dynamic training and transmission conditions, necessitates a novel approach beyond conventional optimization solutions. To tackle these challenges, convergence analysis with respect to adaptive and biased scheduling is derived. Then, by factoring in real-time system and statistical information, including diverse energy constraints and users' energy harvesting capabilities, a deep reinforcement learning approach, empowered by proximal policy optimization, is employed to adaptively select user sets. For the scheduled users, Lagrangian decomposition is applied to optimize local resource utilization, further enhancing system efficiency. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework for various FL tasks, demonstrating reduced task time compared to existing benchmarks under various settings.</description>

   <title>PlaceIt3D: Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05288</link>
   <description>We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.</description>

   <title>LUSIFER: Language Universal Space Integration for Enhanced Multilingual Embeddings with Large Language Models</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00874</link>
   <description>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) based embedding models have established new state-of-the-art benchmarks for text embedding tasks, particularly in dense vector-based retrieval. However, these models predominantly focus on English, leaving multilingual embedding capabilities largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we present LUSIFER, a novel zero-shot approach that adapts LLM-based embedding models for multilingual tasks without requiring multilingual supervision. LUSIFER's architecture combines a multilingual encoder, serving as a language-universal learner, with an LLM-based embedding model optimized for embedding-specific tasks. These components are seamlessly integrated through a minimal set of trainable parameters that act as a connector, effectively transferring the multilingual encoder's language understanding capabilities to the specialized embedding model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate multilingual embedding performance, we introduce a new benchmark encompassing 5 primary embedding tasks, 123 diverse datasets, and coverage across 14 languages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LUSIFER significantly enhances the multilingual performance across various embedding tasks, particularly for medium and low-resource languages, without requiring explicit multilingual training data.</description>

   <title>QualBench: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs with Localized Professional Qualifications for Vertical Domain Evaluation</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05225</link>
   <description>The rapid advancement of Chinese large language models (LLMs) underscores the need for domain-specific evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However, existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with Federated Learning.</description>

   <title>Toward Reasonable Parrots: Why Large Language Models Should Argue with Us by Design</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05298</link>
   <description>In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.</description>

   <title>ValuesRAG: Enhancing Cultural Alignment Through Retrieval-Augmented Contextual Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01031</link>
   <description>Ensuring cultural values alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, as these models often embed Western-centric biases from their training data, leading to misrepresentations and fairness concerns in cross-cultural applications. Existing approaches such as role assignment and few-shot learning struggle to address these limitations effectively due to their reliance on pre-trained knowledge, limited scalability, and inability to capture nuanced cultural values. To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. We subsequently curate several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. We evaluate ValuesRAG using 6 diverse regional datasets and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: including zero-shot, role-assignment, few-shot, and hybrid methods, both in main experiments and ablation settings. Notably, ValuesRAG achieves the best overall performance over prior methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in fostering culturally aligned and inclusive AI systems. Our findings underscore the potential of dynamic retrieval-based methods to bridge the gap between global LLM capabilities and localized cultural values.</description>

   <title>Federated Deconfounding and Debiasing Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04979</link>
   <description>Attribute bias in federated learning (FL) typically leads local models to optimize inconsistently due to the learning of non-causal associations, resulting degraded performance. Existing methods either use data augmentation for increasing sample diversity or knowledge distillation for learning invariant representations to address this problem. However, they lack a comprehensive analysis of the inference paths, and the interference from confounding factors limits their performance. To address these limitations, we propose the \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}econfounding and \underline{D}ebiasing \underline{L}earning (FedDDL) method. It constructs a structured causal graph to analyze the model inference process, and performs backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounding paths. Specifically, we design an intra-client deconfounding learning module for computer vision tasks to decouple background and objects, generating counterfactual samples that establish a connection between the background and any label, which stops the model from using the background to infer the label. Moreover, we design an inter-client debiasing learning module to construct causal prototypes to reduce the proportion of the background in prototype components. Notably, it bridges the gap between heterogeneous representations via causal prototypical regularization. Extensive experiments on 2 benchmarking datasets demonstrate that \methodname{} significantly enhances the model capability to focus on main objects in unseen data, leading to 4.5\% higher Top-1 Accuracy on average over 9 state-of-the-art existing methods.</description>

   <title>Federated EndoViT: Pretraining Vision Transformers via Federated Learning on Endoscopic Image Collections</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16612</link>
   <description>Purpose: In this study, we investigate the training of foundation models using federated learning to address data-sharing limitations and enable collaborative model training without data transfer for minimally invasive surgery. Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.</description>
