   <title>Efficient LLM Inference over Heterogeneous Edge Networks with Speculative Decoding</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11331</link>
   <description>Large language model (LLM) inference at the network edge is a promising serving paradigm that leverages distributed edge resources to run inference near users and enhance privacy. Existing edge-based LLM inference systems typically adopt autoregressive decoding (AD), which only generates one token per forward pass. This iterative process, compounded by the limited computational resources of edge nodes, results in high serving latency and constrains the system's ability to support multiple users under growing demands.To address these challenges, we propose a speculative decoding (SD)-based LLM serving framework that deploys small and large models across heterogeneous edge nodes to collaboratively deliver inference services. Specifically, the small model rapidly generates draft tokens that the large model verifies in parallel, enabling multi-token generation per forward pass and thus reducing serving latency. To improve resource utilization of edge nodes, we incorporate pipeline parallelism to overlap drafting and verification across multiple inference tasks. Based on this framework, we analyze and derive a comprehensive latency model incorporating both communication and inference latency. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for speculation length, task batching, and wireless communication resource allocation to minimize total serving latency. To address this problem, we derive the closed-form solutions for wireless communication resource allocation, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm for joint batching and speculation control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves lower serving latency compared to AD-based serving systems. In addition,the proposed joint optimization method delivers up to 44.9% latency reduction compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

   <title>Multi Camera Connected Vision System with Multi View Analytics: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09731</link>
   <description>Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However, deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups, overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex, real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and adaptive CVS.</description>

   <title>Cooperative Pseudo Labeling for Unsupervised Federated Classification</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10100</link>
   <description>Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

   <title>Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11693</link>
   <description>Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.</description>

   <title>VideoAds for Fast-Paced Video Understanding</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09282</link>
   <description>Advertisement videos serve as a rich and valuable source of purpose-driven information, encompassing high-quality visual, textual, and contextual cues designed to engage viewers. They are often more complex than general videos of similar duration due to their structured narratives and rapid scene transitions, posing significant challenges to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we introduce VideoAds, the first dataset tailored for benchmarking the performance of MLLMs on advertisement videos. VideoAds comprises well-curated advertisement videos with complex temporal structures, accompanied by \textbf{manually} annotated diverse questions across three core tasks: visual finding, video summary, and visual reasoning. We propose a quantitative measure to compare VideoAds against existing benchmarks in terms of video complexity. Through extensive experiments, we find that Qwen2.5-VL-72B, an opensource MLLM, achieves 73.35\% accuracy on VideoAds, outperforming GPT-4o (66.82\%) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (69.66\%); the two proprietary models especially fall behind the opensource model in video summarization and reasoning, but perform the best in visual finding. Notably, human experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\%. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and highlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in understanding video that requires high FPS sampling. The dataset and evaluation code will be publicly available at https://videoadsbenchmark.netlify.app.</description>

   <title>GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks Through Adaptive Neural Architecture Search</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20725</link>
   <description>Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.</description>

   <title>LoRA-FAIR: Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning with Aggregation and Initialization Refinement</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961</link>
   <description>Foundation models (FMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.</description>

   <title>SysLLMatic: Large Language Models are Software System Optimizers</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01249</link>
   <description>Automatic software system optimization can improve software speed and save energy. Traditional approaches to optimization rely on manual tuning and compiler heuristics, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse codebases. Recent methods using LLMs introduce automation, but they do not scale effectively to the complexity and size of real-world software systems, leaving a gap in practical applicability. We present SysLLMatic, a system that integrates LLMs with performance diagnostics feedback and a curated catalog of 43 optimization patterns to automatically optimize software code. Our approach builds on recent advances in LLM-based code optimization and specifically targets the limitations of existing systems in handling real-world software applications. We evaluate it on three benchmark suites: HumanEval_CPP (competitive programming in C++), SciMark2 (scientific kernels in Java), and DaCapoBench (large-scale software systems in Java). Results show that SysLLMatic can improve software system performance, including latency, throughput, energy efficiency, memory usage, and CPU utilization. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM baselines on microbenchmarks. On large-scale application codes, to which prior LLM approaches have not scaled, it surpasses compiler optimizations, achieving average relative improvements of 1.5x in latency (vs. 1.01x for the compiler) and 1.76x in throughput (vs. 1.02x for the compiler). Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, guided by principled system thinking through the optimization pattern catalog and appropriate performance diagnostics, can serve as viable software system optimizers. We further identify limitations of our approach and the challenges involved in handling complex applications. This work provides a foundation for generating optimized code across various languages, benchmarks, and program sizes in a principled manner.</description>

   <title>Incentivize Contribution and Learn Parameters Too: Federated Learning with Strategic Data Owners</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12010</link>
   <description>Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution in a truthful manner, which distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and simultaneously learn the model parameters. We also ensure that agents are incentivized to truthfully reveal information in the intermediate stages of the algorithm. However, this equilibrium outcome can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism that enables the full data contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and Twitter) show that these algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees and better model performance for all agents.</description>

   <title>Evaluation of Differential Privacy Mechanisms on Federated Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09691</link>
   <description>Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget. However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem, adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy while preserving privacy.</description>

   <title>RLFR: Extending Reinforcement Learning for LLMs with Flow Environment</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10201</link>
   <description>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space, and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.</description>

   <title>A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Multi-Objective LLM Interactions: Dynamical Systems Analysis with Code Generation Applications</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10739</link>
   <description>We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29, and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.</description>

   <title>FedHybrid: Breaking the Memory Wall of Federated Learning via Hybrid Tensor Management</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11400</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid} first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that \textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a 15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared with the baselines.</description>

   <title>Grounded AI for Code Review: Resource-Efficient Large-Model Serving in Enterprise Pipelines</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10290</link>
   <description>Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack (quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++ standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50 build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader standards and assisted patching.</description>

   <title>FLAMMABLE: A Multi-Model Federated Learning Framework with Multi-Model Engagement and Adaptive Batch Sizes</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10380</link>
   <description>Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) is an emerging direction in Federated Learning (FL) where multiple models are trained in parallel, generally on various datasets. Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor na\&quot;ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round. To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.</description>

   <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
   <description>For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

   <title>LLMEasyQuant: Scalable Quantization for Parallel and Distributed LLM Inference</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19657</link>
   <description>As large language models (LLMs) grow in size and deployment scale, quantization has become an essential technique for reducing memory footprint and improving inference efficiency. However, existing quantization toolkits often lack transparency, flexibility, and system-level scalability across GPUs and distributed environments. We present \textbf{LLMEasyQuant}, a modular, system-aware quantization framework designed for efficient, low-bit inference of LLMs on single-node multi-GPU, multi-node, and edge hardware. LLMEasyQuant supports a wide range of quantization methods -- including Symmetric Quantization, ZeroQuant, SmoothQuant, and SimQuant -- with unified interfaces for per-layer calibration, bitwidth assignment, and runtime adaptation. It integrates fused CUDA kernels with NCCL-based distributed synchronization and supports both static and online quantization. Empirical results show that LLMEasyQuant can achieve substantial speedup in GEMM execution, HBM load time, and near-linear multi-GPU scaling. Ablation studies further validate its ability to balance latency, memory, and accuracy under diverse deployment conditions. LLMEasyQuant offers a practical quantization serving system for scalable, hardware-optimized LLM inference.</description>

   <title>LoRA-FAIR: Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning with Aggregation and Initialization Refinement</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14961</link>
   <description>Foundation models (FMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.</description>

   <title>Robust Federated Finetuning of LLMs via Alternating Optimization of LoRA</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01755</link>
   <description>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimize federated training by reducing computational and communication costs. We propose RoLoRA, a federated framework using alternating optimization to fine-tune LoRA adapters. Our approach emphasizes the importance of learning up and down projection matrices to enhance expressiveness and robustness. We use both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over prior approaches that either generate imperfect model updates or limit expressiveness of the model. We provide a theoretical analysis on a linear model to highlight the importance of learning both the down-projection and up-projection matrices in LoRA. We validate the insights on a non-linear model and separately provide a convergence proof under general conditions. To bridge theory and practice, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations on language models including RoBERTa-Large, Llama-2-7B on diverse tasks and FL settings to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over other methods.</description>

   <title>Adaptive UAV-Assisted Hierarchical Federated Learning: Optimizing Energy, Latency, and Resilience for Dynamic Smart IoT</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06145</link>
   <description>Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) extends conventional Federated Learning (FL) by introducing intermediate aggregation layers, enabling distributed learning in geographically dispersed environments, particularly relevant for smart IoT systems, such as remote monitoring and battlefield operations, where cellular connectivity is limited. In these scenarios, UAVs serve as mobile aggregators, dynamically connecting terrestrial IoT devices. This paper investigates an HFL architecture with energy-constrained, dynamically deployed UAVs prone to communication disruptions. We propose a novel approach to minimize global training costs by formulating a joint optimization problem that integrates learning configuration, bandwidth allocation, and device-to-UAV association, ensuring timely global aggregation before UAV disconnections and redeployments. The problem accounts for dynamic IoT devices and intermittent UAV connectivity and is NP-hard. To tackle this, we decompose it into three subproblems: \textit{(i)} optimizing learning configuration and bandwidth allocation via an augmented Lagrangian to reduce training costs; \textit{(ii)} introducing a device fitness score based on data heterogeneity (via Kullback-Leibler divergence), device-to-UAV proximity, and computational resources, using a TD3-based algorithm for adaptive device-to-UAV assignment; \textit{(iii)} developing a low-complexity two-stage greedy strategy for UAV redeployment and global aggregator selection, ensuring efficient aggregation despite UAV disconnections. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets validate the approach, demonstrating cost reduction and robust performance under communication disruptions.</description>

   <title>Personalized Bayesian Federated Learning with Wasserstein Barycenter Aggregation</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14161</link>
   <description>Personalized Bayesian federated learning (PBFL) handles non-i.i.d. client data and quantifies uncertainty by combining personalization with Bayesian inference. However, existing PBFL methods face two limitations: restrictive parametric assumptions in client posterior inference and naive parameter averaging for server aggregation. To overcome these issues, we propose FedWBA, a novel PBFL method that enhances both local inference and global aggregation. At the client level, we use particle-based variational inference for nonparametric posterior representation. At the server level, we introduce particle-based Wasserstein barycenter aggregation, offering a more geometrically meaningful approach. Theoretically, we provide local and global convergence guarantees for FedWBA. Locally, we prove a KL divergence decrease lower bound per iteration for variational inference convergence. Globally, we show that the Wasserstein barycenter converges to the true parameter as the client data size increases. Empirically, experiments show that FedWBA outperforms baselines in prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and convergence rate, with ablation studies confirming its robustness.</description>

   <title>Inclusive, Differentially Private Federated Learning for Clinical Data</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22108</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.</description>

   <title>Wavelet Scattering Transform and Fourier Representation for Offline Detection of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09674</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection, WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.</description>

   <title>A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315</link>
   <description>Defending backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous client data distributions encounters limitations balancing effectiveness and privacy-preserving, while most existing methods highly rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset. In this paper, we propose an FL backdoor defense framework, named CLIP-Fed, that utilizes the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. Our scheme overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness by integrating pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies. CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence, so that class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples are ensured and the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels is eliminated. In order to balance privacy-preserving and coverage enhancement of the dataset against diverse triggers, we further construct and augment the server dataset via using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Comparing to other existing methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in Attack Success Rate, {\em i.e.}, 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average Main Task Accuracy by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIP-Fed.</description>

   <title>Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization: Entropy Is Controllable in Reinforcement Fine-tuning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08141</link>
   <description>Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1) stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy, exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE regularizers.</description>

   <title>Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Synergistic Training-Inference Optimization</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605</link>
   <description>Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.</description>

   <title>Incentivize Contribution and Learn Parameters Too: Federated Learning with Strategic Data Owners</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12010</link>
   <description>Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution in a truthful manner, which distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and simultaneously learn the model parameters. We also ensure that agents are incentivized to truthfully reveal information in the intermediate stages of the algorithm. However, this equilibrium outcome can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism that enables the full data contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and Twitter) show that these algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees and better model performance for all agents.</description>

   <title>mCLM: A Modular Chemical Language Model that Generates Functional and Makeable Molecules</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12565</link>
   <description>Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with desired functions (e.g., drug-like properties). In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make, and are almost never compatible with automated synthesis approaches. To better enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a new molecular language that is more effective in predicting properties and inherently synced with automated synthesis technology. Current molecule LLMs are limited by representing molecules based on atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into meaning-bearing (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be tokenized at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model that comprises a bilingual language model that understands both natural language descriptions of functions and molecular blocks. mCLM front-loads synthesizability considerations while improving the predicted functions of molecules in a principled manner. mCLM, with only 3B parameters, achieves improvements in synthetic accessibility relative to 7 other leading generative AI methods including GPT-5. When tested on 122 out-of-distribution medicines using only building blocks/tokens that are compatible with automated modular synthesis, mCLM outperforms all baselines in property scores and synthetic accessibility. mCLM can also reason on multiple functions and iteratively self-improve to rescue drug candidates that failed late in clinical trials (&quot;fallen angels&quot;).</description>

   <title>Evaluation of Differential Privacy Mechanisms on Federated Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09691</link>
   <description>Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget. However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem, adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy while preserving privacy.</description>

   <title>RLFR: Extending Reinforcement Learning for LLMs with Flow Environment</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10201</link>
   <description>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space, and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.</description>

   <title>MetaBreak: Jailbreaking Online LLM Services via Special Token Manipulation</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10271</link>
   <description>Unlike regular tokens derived from existing text corpora, special tokens are artificially created to annotate structured conversations during the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Serving as metadata of training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging, as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated. This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively. Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%, respectively.</description>

   <title>Assessing Large Language Models for Structured Medical Order Extraction</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10475</link>
   <description>Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission, which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering, can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.</description>

   <title>A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Multi-Objective LLM Interactions: Dynamical Systems Analysis with Code Generation Applications</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10739</link>
   <description>We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29, and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.</description>

   <title>Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11693</link>
   <description>Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.</description>

   <title>GI-NAS: Boosting Gradient Inversion Attacks Through Adaptive Neural Architecture Search</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20725</link>
   <description>Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.</description>

   <title>mCLM: A Modular Chemical Language Model that Generates Functional and Makeable Molecules</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12565</link>
   <description>Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with desired functions (e.g., drug-like properties). In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make, and are almost never compatible with automated synthesis approaches. To better enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a new molecular language that is more effective in predicting properties and inherently synced with automated synthesis technology. Current molecule LLMs are limited by representing molecules based on atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into meaning-bearing (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be tokenized at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model that comprises a bilingual language model that understands both natural language descriptions of functions and molecular blocks. mCLM front-loads synthesizability considerations while improving the predicted functions of molecules in a principled manner. mCLM, with only 3B parameters, achieves improvements in synthetic accessibility relative to 7 other leading generative AI methods including GPT-5. When tested on 122 out-of-distribution medicines using only building blocks/tokens that are compatible with automated modular synthesis, mCLM outperforms all baselines in property scores and synthetic accessibility. mCLM can also reason on multiple functions and iteratively self-improve to rescue drug candidates that failed late in clinical trials (&quot;fallen angels&quot;).</description>

   <title>How Memory Management Impacts LLM Agents: An Empirical Study of Experience-Following Behavior</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16067</link>
   <description>Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents, enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory management operations that are widely used by many agent frameworks-memory addition and deletion-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay, where some seemingly correct executions can provide limited or even misleading value as experiences. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate the importance of regulating experience quality within the memory bank and show that future task evaluations can serve as free quality labels for stored memory. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory components that support robust, long-term agent performance.</description>

   <title>Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703</link>
   <description>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</description>

   <title>oMeBench: Towards Robust Benchmarking of LLMs in Organic Mechanism Elucidation and Reasoning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07731</link>
   <description>Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS, a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition, they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.</description>

   <title>Robust Federated Finetuning of LLMs via Alternating Optimization of LoRA</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01755</link>
   <description>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimize federated training by reducing computational and communication costs. We propose RoLoRA, a federated framework using alternating optimization to fine-tune LoRA adapters. Our approach emphasizes the importance of learning up and down projection matrices to enhance expressiveness and robustness. We use both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over prior approaches that either generate imperfect model updates or limit expressiveness of the model. We provide a theoretical analysis on a linear model to highlight the importance of learning both the down-projection and up-projection matrices in LoRA. We validate the insights on a non-linear model and separately provide a convergence proof under general conditions. To bridge theory and practice, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations on language models including RoBERTa-Large, Llama-2-7B on diverse tasks and FL settings to demonstrate the advantages of RoLoRA over other methods.</description>

   <title>Forecasting Clinical Risk from Textual Time Series: Structuring Narratives for Temporal AI in Healthcare</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10340</link>
   <description>Clinical case reports encode temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</description>

   <title>Inclusive, Differentially Private Federated Learning for Clinical Data</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22108</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.</description>

   <title>A Vision-Language Pre-training Model-Guided Approach for Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10315</link>
   <description>Defending backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) under heterogeneous client data distributions encounters limitations balancing effectiveness and privacy-preserving, while most existing methods highly rely on the assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a clean serve dataset. In this paper, we propose an FL backdoor defense framework, named CLIP-Fed, that utilizes the zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. Our scheme overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness by integrating pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies. CLIP-Fed aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence, so that class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples are ensured and the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels is eliminated. In order to balance privacy-preserving and coverage enhancement of the dataset against diverse triggers, we further construct and augment the server dataset via using the multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client samples. Extensive experiments on representative datasets evidence the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed. Comparing to other existing methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in Attack Success Rate, {\em i.e.}, 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving average Main Task Accuracy by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively. Our codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIP-Fed.</description>

   <title>Question-Driven Analysis and Synthesis: Building Interpretable Thematic Trees with LLMs for Text Clustering and Controllable Generation</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22211</link>
   <description>Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.</description>

   <title>FedMon: Federated eBPF Monitoring for Distributed Anomaly Detection in Multi-Cluster Cloud Environments</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10126</link>
   <description>Kubernetes multi-cluster deployments demand scalable and privacy-preserving anomaly detection. Existing eBPF-based monitors provide low-overhead system and network visibility but are limited to single clusters, while centralized approaches incur bandwidth, privacy, and heterogeneity challenges. We propose FedMon, a federated eBPF framework that unifies kernel-level telemetry with federated learning (FL) for cross-cluster anomaly detection. Lightweight eBPF agents capture syscalls and network events, extract local statistical and sequence features, and share only model updates with a global server. A hybrid detection engine combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Isolation Forests enables both temporal pattern modeling and outlier detection. Deployed across three Kubernetes clusters, FedMon achieves 94% precision, 91% recall, and an F1-score of 0.92, while cutting bandwidth usage by 60% relative to centralized baselines. Results demonstrate that FedMon enhances accuracy, scalability, and privacy, providing an effective defense for large-scale, multi-tenant cloud-native environments.</description>

   <title>FLAMMABLE: A Multi-Model Federated Learning Framework with Multi-Model Engagement and Adaptive Batch Sizes</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10380</link>
   <description>Multi-Model Federated Learning (MMFL) is an emerging direction in Federated Learning (FL) where multiple models are trained in parallel, generally on various datasets. Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor na\&quot;ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round. To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\sim$10.0$\times$ while improving the final model accuracy by 1.3$\sim$5.4\% compared to several known baselines.</description>

   <title>An Explorative Study on Distributed Computing Techniques in Training and Inference of Large Language Models</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11211</link>
   <description>Large language models (LLM) are advanced AI systems trained on extensive textual data, leveraging deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like language. Today's LLMs with billions of parameters are so huge that hardly any single computing node can train, fine-tune, or infer from them. Therefore, several distributed computing techniques are being introduced in the literature to properly utilize LLMs. We have explored the application of distributed computing techniques in LLMs from two angles.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We study the techniques that democratize the LLM, that is, how large models can be run on consumer-grade computers. Here, we also implement a novel metaheuristics-based modification to an existing system.
  \item We perform a comparative study on three state-of-the-art LLM serving techniques. \end{itemize}</description>

   <title>Bridging Memory Gaps: Scaling Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Clients</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10826</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data privacy. However, the high memory demand during model training severely limits the deployment of FL on resource-constrained clients. To this end, we propose \our, a scalable and inclusive FL framework designed to overcome memory limitations through sequential block-wise training. The core idea of \our is to partition the global model into blocks and train them sequentially, thereby reducing training memory requirements. To mitigate information loss during block-wise training, \our introduces a Curriculum Mentor that crafts curriculum-aware training objectives for each block to steer their learning process. Moreover, \our incorporates a Training Harmonizer that designs a parameter co-adaptation training scheme to coordinate block updates, effectively breaking inter-block information isolation. Extensive experiments on both simulation and hardware testbeds demonstrate that \our significantly improves model performance by up to 84.2\%, reduces peak memory usage by up to 50.4\%, and accelerates training by up to 1.9$\times$.</description>

   <title>Inclusive, Differentially Private Federated Learning for Clinical Data</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22108</link>
   <description>Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.</description>

   <title>CardRewriter: Leveraging Knowledge Cards for Long-Tail Query Rewriting on Short-Video Platforms</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10095</link>
   <description>Short-video platforms have rapidly become a new generation of information retrieval systems, where users formulate queries to access desired videos. However, user queries, especially long-tail ones, often suffer from spelling errors, incomplete phrasing, and ambiguous intent, resulting in mismatches between user expectations and retrieved results. While large language models (LLMs) have shown success in long-tail query rewriting within e-commerce, they struggle on short-video platforms, where proprietary content such as short videos, live streams, micro dramas, and user social networks falls outside their training distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CardRewriter}, an LLM-based framework that incorporates domain-specific knowledge to enhance long-tail query rewriting. For each query, our method aggregates multi-source knowledge relevant to the query and summarizes it into an informative and query-relevant knowledge card. This card then guides the LLM to better capture user intent and produce more effective query rewrites. We optimize CardRewriter using a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by group relative policy optimization, with a tailored reward system balancing query relevance and retrieval effectiveness. Offline experiments show that CardRewriter substantially improves rewriting quality for queries targeting proprietary content. Online A/B testing further confirms significant gains in long-view rate (LVR) and click-through rate (CTR), along with a notable reduction in initiative query reformulation rate (IQRR). Since September 2025, CardRewriter has been deployed on Kuaishou, one of China's largest short-video platforms, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.</description>

   <title>DyKnow-RAG: Dynamic Knowledge Utilization Reinforcement Framework for Noisy Retrieval-Augmented Generation in E-commerce Search Relevance</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11122</link>
   <description>Accurately modeling query-item relevance drives e-commerce ranking, yet long-tail, knowledge-heavy, and fast-evolving queries exceed parametric LLM coverage. External context (reviews, attribute encyclopedias, UGC) can help but is noisy, and single-pass latency and cost forbid any clean-then-summarize step. The model must, per query, judge relevance and decide whether to use, partially use, or ignore the context. DyKnow-RAG is a dynamic noisy-RAG framework built on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It trains two rollout groups (no external context vs a single retrieved chunk) and applies posterior-driven inter-group advantage scaling that adaptively reweights their contributions by the per-query correctness gap. This teaches when to trust retrieval versus fall back to parametric knowledge, without process labels, value networks, or extra inference passes, preserving single-pass, single-chunk deployment under production latency. Training combines: (1) supervised initialization with a structured rationale that explicitly records the context-usage decision; (2) an RL pool prioritized by SFT uncertainty to focus where context choice is most consequential; and (3) an optional lightweight DPO warm start to stabilize with-context calibration. Under a unified retrieval/index and fixed latency budget, DyKnow-RAG outperforms SFT, DPO, and vanilla GRPO in offline tests, and delivers consistent lifts on GSB, Query Goodrate, and Item Goodrate in Taobao A/B testing. It is deployed in Taobao's production relevance system, serving live traffic. To our knowledge, it is among the first single-pass RAG solutions for e-commerce relevance, turning noisy external signals into reliable gains without added online complexity.</description>

   <title>Assessing Large Language Models for Structured Medical Order Extraction</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10475</link>
   <description>Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission, which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering, can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.</description>

   <title>Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Representation Learning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11693</link>
   <description>Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.</description>

   <title>RLFR: Extending Reinforcement Learning for LLMs with Flow Environment</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10201</link>
   <description>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space, and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.</description>

   <title>Evolving LLMs' Self-Refinement Capability via Synergistic Training-Inference Optimization</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05605</link>
   <description>Self-Refinement refers to a model's ability to revise its own responses to produce improved outputs. This capability can also serve as a fundamental mechanism for Self-Improvement, for example, by reconstructing datasets with refined results to enhance intrinsic model performance. However, our comprehensive experiments reveal that large language models (LLMs) show no clear evidence of inherent Self-Refinement and may even experience response quality degradation after Self-Refinement. To address this issue, we propose EVOLVE, a simple and effective framework for eliciting and tracking the evolution of Self-Refinement through iterative training. We first explore optimization methods during training to activate the model's Self-Refinement capability. Then, at inference, we investigate various generation strategies to further enhance and utilize Self-Refinement while supplying the necessary data for training. Through synergistic optimization of training and inference stages, we continually evolve the model's Self-Refinement ability, enabling it to better refine its own responses. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging Self-Refinement to achieve broader Self-Improvement of intrinsic model abilities. Experiments show that the evolved Self-Refinement ability enables the Llama-3.1-8B base model to surpass GPT-4o, achieving 62.3% length-controlled and 63.3% raw win rates on AlpacaEval 2, and 50.3% on Arena-Hard. It also generalizes effectively to out-of-domain reasoning tasks, improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH.</description>

   <title>Forecasting Clinical Risk from Textual Time Series: Structuring Narratives for Temporal AI in Healthcare</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10340</link>
   <description>Clinical case reports encode temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</description>

   <title>Question-Driven Analysis and Synthesis: Building Interpretable Thematic Trees with LLMs for Text Clustering and Controllable Generation</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22211</link>
   <description>Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.</description>

   <title>mCLM: A Modular Chemical Language Model that Generates Functional and Makeable Molecules</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12565</link>
   <description>Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge, large language models (LLMs) remain limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with desired functions (e.g., drug-like properties). In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make, and are almost never compatible with automated synthesis approaches. To better enable the discovery of functional small molecules, LLMs need to learn a new molecular language that is more effective in predicting properties and inherently synced with automated synthesis technology. Current molecule LLMs are limited by representing molecules based on atoms. In this paper, we argue that just like tokenizing texts into meaning-bearing (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules should be tokenized at the level of functional building blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model that comprises a bilingual language model that understands both natural language descriptions of functions and molecular blocks. mCLM front-loads synthesizability considerations while improving the predicted functions of molecules in a principled manner. mCLM, with only 3B parameters, achieves improvements in synthetic accessibility relative to 7 other leading generative AI methods including GPT-5. When tested on 122 out-of-distribution medicines using only building blocks/tokens that are compatible with automated modular synthesis, mCLM outperforms all baselines in property scores and synthetic accessibility. mCLM can also reason on multiple functions and iteratively self-improve to rescue drug candidates that failed late in clinical trials (&quot;fallen angels&quot;).</description>

   <title>Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703</link>
   <description>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning (NFL-HR)**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the NL-FL Problem Alignment method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the Mixed Problem Input technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based Answer Extraction mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the NFL-HR framework achieves **89.80**% and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by **4.60%** and **4.82%**, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</description>

   <title>oMeBench: Towards Robust Benchmarking of LLMs in Organic Mechanism Elucidation and Reasoning</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07731</link>
   <description>Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS, a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition, they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.</description>

   <title>Grounded AI for Code Review: Resource-Efficient Large-Model Serving in Enterprise Pipelines</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10290</link>
   <description>Automated code review adoption lags in compliance-heavy settings, where static analyzers produce high-volume, low-rationale outputs, and naive LLM use risks hallucination and incurring cost overhead. We present a production system for grounded, PR-native review that pairs static-analysis findings with AST-guided context extraction and a single-GPU, on-demand serving stack (quantized open-weight model, multi-tier caching) to deliver concise explanations and remediation guidance. Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++ standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50 build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants reporting fewer human review iterations. We outline operational lessons and limitations, emphasizing reproducibility, auditability, and pathways to broader standards and assisted patching.</description>

   <title>A Stochastic Differential Equation Framework for Multi-Objective LLM Interactions: Dynamical Systems Analysis with Code Generation Applications</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10739</link>
   <description>We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29, and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM interactions, with code generation serving as an initial validation domain.</description>

   <description>Context: Manual qualitative data analysis is time-intensive and can compromise validity and replicability, affecting analysis design, implementation, and reporting. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable human-bot collaboration in Software Engineering (SE), but their potential for qualitative data analysis in SE remains largely unexplored.
  Objective: The objective of this study is to design and develop an LLM-based multi-agent system that synergizes human decision support with AI to automate various qualitative data analysis approaches.
  Methods: We used LLM-based multi-agents systems to assist the qualitative data analysis process, deploying 27 agents, each responsible for a specific task, such as text summarization, initial code generation, and extracting themes and patterns.
  Results: The main findings are: (1) the LLM-based multi-agent system accelerates the qualitative data analysis process, (2) the system effectively automates tasks such as text summarization, initial code generation, and theme extraction, and (3) the publicly accessible code facilitates validation and further evaluation.
  Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based multi-agent system automates qualitative data analysis process, creating opportunities for researchers and practitioners. Future improvements focus on enhancing multilingual performance and integrating continuous expert feedback.

   <title>SysLLMatic: Large Language Models are Software System Optimizers</title>
   <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01249</link>
   <description>Automatic software system optimization can improve software speed and save energy. Traditional approaches to optimization rely on manual tuning and compiler heuristics, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse codebases. Recent methods using LLMs introduce automation, but they do not scale effectively to the complexity and size of real-world software systems, leaving a gap in practical applicability. We present SysLLMatic, a system that integrates LLMs with performance diagnostics feedback and a curated catalog of 43 optimization patterns to automatically optimize software code. Our approach builds on recent advances in LLM-based code optimization and specifically targets the limitations of existing systems in handling real-world software applications. We evaluate it on three benchmark suites: HumanEval_CPP (competitive programming in C++), SciMark2 (scientific kernels in Java), and DaCapoBench (large-scale software systems in Java). Results show that SysLLMatic can improve software system performance, including latency, throughput, energy efficiency, memory usage, and CPU utilization. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM baselines on microbenchmarks. On large-scale application codes, to which prior LLM approaches have not scaled, it surpasses compiler optimizations, achieving average relative improvements of 1.5x in latency (vs. 1.01x for the compiler) and 1.76x in throughput (vs. 1.02x for the compiler). Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, guided by principled system thinking through the optimization pattern catalog and appropriate performance diagnostics, can serve as viable software system optimizers. We further identify limitations of our approach and the challenges involved in handling complex applications. This work provides a foundation for generating optimized code across various languages, benchmarks, and program sizes in a principled manner.</description>
