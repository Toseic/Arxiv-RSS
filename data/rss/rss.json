However, existing approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage visual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data and is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT reasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons between model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is dis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such preference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an image, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using a template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as input. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these rankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by minimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human perception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can improve visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where textual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets demonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual and visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the strong generalization of UV-CoT.

VFedMH focuses on aggregating the local embeddings of each participant's knowledge during forward propagation. To protect the participants' local embedding values, we propose an embedding protection method based on lightweight blinding factors. In particular, participants obtain local embedding using local heterogeneous models. Then the passive party, who owns only features of the sample, injects the blinding factor into the local embedding and sends it to the active party. The active party aggregates local embeddings to obtain global knowledge embeddings and sends them to passive parties. The passive parties then utilize the global embeddings to propagate forward on their local heterogeneous networks. However, the passive party does not own the sample labels, so the local model gradient cannot be calculated locally. To overcome this limitation, the active party assists the passive party in computing its local heterogeneous model gradients. Then, each participant trains their local model using the heterogeneous model gradients. The objective is to minimize the loss value of their respective local heterogeneous models.

Logistic regression is considered for the VFL model. One party, referred to as the active party, possesses the ground truth labels of the samples in the training phase, while the other, referred to as the passive party, only shares a separate set of features corresponding to these samples. It is shown that the active party can carry out inference attacks on both training and prediction phase samples by acquiring an ML model independently trained on the training samples available to them. This type of inference attack does not require the active party to be aware of the score of a specific sample, hence it is referred to as an agnostic inference attack. It is shown that utilizing the observed confidence scores during the prediction phase, before the time of the attack, can improve the performance of the active party's autonomous ML model, and thus improve the quality of the agnostic inference attack. As a countermeasure, privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) are proposed. While the proposed schemes preserve the utility of the VFL model, they systematically distort the VFL parameters corresponding to the passive party's features. The level of the distortion imposed on the passive party's parameters is adjustable, giving rise to a trade-off between privacy of the passive party and interpretabiliy of the VFL outcomes by the active party. The distortion level of the passive party's parameters could be chosen carefully according to the privacy and interpretabiliy concerns of the passive and active parties, respectively, with the hope of keeping both parties (partially) satisfied.

However, existing VFL methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous local models among participants, which affects optimization convergence and generalization. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach called Vertical federated learning for training multiple Heterogeneous models (VFedMH). VFedMH focuses on aggregating the local embeddings of each participant's knowledge during forward propagation. To protect the participants' local embedding values, we propose an embedding protection method based on lightweight blinding factors. In particular, participants obtain local embedding using local heterogeneous models. Then the passive party, who owns only features of the sample, injects the blinding factor into the local embedding and sends it to the active party. The active party aggregates local embeddings to obtain global knowledge embeddings and sends them to passive parties. The passive parties then utilize the global embeddings to propagate forward on their local heterogeneous networks. However, the passive party does not own the sample labels, so the local model gradient cannot be calculated locally.

Although several fairness-enhancing solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at both the global and client levels.

Traditional reference-based automatic metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR have notable limitations in assessing commit message quality, as they assume a one-to-one mapping between code changes and commit messages, leading researchers to rely on resource-intensive human evaluation. This study investigates the potential of LLMs as automated evaluators for commit message quality. Through systematic experimentation with various prompt strategies and state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that LLMs combining Chain-of-Thought reasoning with few-shot demonstrations achieve near human-level evaluation proficiency.

To preserve user privacy without compromising the utility of the global model, secure aggregation emerges as a promising approach by coordinating the use of privacy-preserving noise (secret keys) across participating clients. However, the unreliable communication will randomly disrupt the key coordination and disable the exact recovery of the global model in secure aggregation. Furthermore, unreliable communication can distort the optimization trajectory, causing the global model to deviate further from the intended global optimum.To address these challenges, we propose Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding (SecCoGC), a practical solution that achieves accurate aggregation with arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees and is inherently robust to communication uncertainties. To ensure fairness in privacy protection, we further introduce Fair-SecCoGC, an extension of SecCoGC that enforces equitable privacy preservation across all clients. Notably, Fair-SecCoGC achieves optimal privacy under a per-key total power constraint. We formally formulate the problem of secure aggregation in the real field and present both general and computationally efficient methods for secret key construction. Our privacy analysis covers both Local Mutual Information Privacy (LMIP) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) across all protocol layers, accounting for intermittent networks and correlation among secret keys. In addition, we characterize the system reliability and convergence properties of the proposed scheme.

Logistic regression is considered for the VFL model. One party, referred to as the active party, possesses the ground truth labels of the samples in the training phase, while the other, referred to as the passive party, only shares a separate set of features corresponding to these samples. It is shown that the active party can carry out inference attacks on both training and prediction phase samples by acquiring an ML model independently trained on the training samples available to them. This type of inference attack does not require the active party to be aware of the score of a specific sample, hence it is referred to as an agnostic inference attack. It is shown that utilizing the observed confidence scores during the prediction phase, before the time of the attack, can improve the performance of the active party's autonomous ML model, and thus improve the quality of the agnostic inference attack. As a countermeasure, privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) are proposed. While the proposed schemes preserve the utility of the VFL model, they systematically distort the VFL parameters corresponding to the passive party's features. The level of the distortion imposed on the passive party's parameters is adjustable, giving rise to a trade-off between privacy of the passive party and interpretabiliy of the VFL outcomes by the active party. The distortion level of the passive party's parameters could be chosen carefully according to the privacy and interpretabiliy concerns of the passive and active parties, respectively, with the hope of keeping both parties (partially) satisfied.
