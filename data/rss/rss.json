However, the soaring energy cost of LLM inference presents a growing challenge for sustainable and cost-effective deployment. This paper introduces VoltanaLLM, a system for SLO-aware, energy-efficient LLM serving, built from a control theory perspective. VoltanaLLM co-designs frequency scaling and request routing in emerging prefill/decode disaggregated architectures, leveraging their decoupled execution to enable fine-grained phase-specific control. It consists of a feedback-driven frequency controller that dynamically adapts GPU frequency for prefill and decode phases, and a state-space router that explores routing decisions across frequency-scaled instances to minimize energy under latency constraints. We implement VoltanaLLM in SGLang and evaluate its performance over multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that VoltanaLLM achieves up to 36.3% energy savings while maintaining near-perfect SLO attainment rate, paving the way for sustainable and intelligent LLM serving.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2509.04827v1", "categories": ["cs.DC"], "pubdate": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "creator": "Jiahuan Yu (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), Aryan Taneja (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign), Junfeng Lin (Tsinghua University), Minjia Zhang (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)"}, {"title": "An Efficient Subspace Algorithm for Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05213", "description": "This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication, computation, and memory.

However, the decentralized data-management paradigm leaves LDPFL vulnerable to participants with malicious intent. The robustness of LDPFL protocols, particularly against model poisoning attacks (MPA), where adversaries inject malicious updates to disrupt global model convergence, remains insufficiently studied. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensible model poisoning attack framework tailored for LDPFL settings. Our approach is driven by the objective of maximizing the global training loss while adhering to local privacy constraints. To counter robust aggregation mechanisms such as Multi-Krum and trimmed mean, we develop adaptive attacks that embed carefully crafted constraints into a reverse training process, enabling evasion of these defenses. We evaluate our framework across three representative LDPFL protocols, three benchmark datasets, and two types of deep neural networks. Additionally, we investigate the influence of data heterogeneity and privacy budgets on attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive attacks can significantly degrade the performance of the global model, revealing critical vulnerabilities and highlighting the need for more robust LDPFL defense strategies against MPA.

In this paradigm, workers locally update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine) participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation, assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines' gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous settings.

Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a novel server-side watermarking method, $\\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL systems demonstrate that $\\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all watermarked models while preserving their main task performance.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2505.13651v3", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.LG"], "pubdate": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Jiahao Xu, Rui Hu, Olivera Kotevska, Zikai Zhang"}, {"title": "Optimal Client Sampling in Federated Learning with Client-Level Heterogeneous Differential Privacy", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13655", "description": "Federated Learning with client-level differential privacy (DP) provides a promising framework for collaboratively training models while rigorously protecting clients' privacy. However, classic approaches like DP-FedAvg struggle when clients have heterogeneous privacy requirements, as they must uniformly enforce the strictest privacy level across clients, leading to excessive DP noise and significant model utility degradation. Existing methods to improve the model utility in such heterogeneous privacy settings often assume a trusted server and are largely heuristic, resulting in suboptimal performance and lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we address these challenges under a practical attack model where both clients and the server are honest-but-curious. We propose GDPFed, which partitions clients into groups based on their privacy budgets and achieves client-level DP within each group to reduce the privacy budget waste and hence improve the model utility. Based on the privacy and convergence analysis of GDPFed, we find that the magnitude of DP noise depends on both model dimensionality and the per-group client sampling ratios. To further improve the performance of GDPFed, we introduce GDPFed$^+$, which integrates model sparsification to eliminate unnecessary noise and optimizes per-group client sampling ratios to minimize convergence error. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GDPFed$^+$, showing substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2505.13655v2", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.LG"], "pubdate": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Jiahao Xu, Rui Hu, Olivera Kotevska"}, {"title": "Translating Federated Learning Algorithms in Python into CSP Processes Using ChatGPT", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07173", "description": "The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL framework that is easy to use by ML&AI developers who do not need to be professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT.
