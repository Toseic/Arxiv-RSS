Although numerous studies and surveys have explored the predictive power and clinical utility of MIMIC based models, critical challenges in data integration, representation, and interoperability remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that focuses uniquely on open problems. We identify persistent issues such as data granularity, cardinality limitations, heterogeneous coding schemes, and ethical constraints that hinder the generalizability and real-time implementation of machine learning models. We highlight key progress in dimensionality reduction, temporal modelling, causal inference, and privacy preserving analytics, while also outlining promising directions including hybrid modelling, federated learning, and standardized preprocessing pipelines.

Notably, federated low-rank adaptation LoRA-based fine-tuning methods have recently gained attention, which allows clients to fine-tune FMs with a small portion of trainable parameters locally. However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous resources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize global fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we propose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that enables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local trainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several heterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local trainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer importance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a Fisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm information. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the intrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA strategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into specific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck, and Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named Randomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with randomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both the dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy. We evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA fine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to extreme Non-IID. Results show that Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies is both effective and efficient.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2506.12213v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.DC"], "pubdate": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Zikai Zhang, Ping Liu, Jiahao Xu, Rui Hu"}, {"title": "Perfect Privacy for Discriminator-Based Byzantine-Resilient Federated Learning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13561", "description": "Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large-scale machine learning but introduces new privacy and security challenges.

However, cultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the misrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and the oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe consequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM for cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been a significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in this area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs in generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query tasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the knowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine both the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts.

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights.

Attackers exploit the perceived urgency and authenticity of voice communication to manipulate victims, often posing as legitimate entities like banks or tech support. Vishing is a particularly serious threat as it bypasses security controls designed to protect information. In this work, we study the potential for vishing attacks to escalate with the advent of AI. In theory, AI-powered software bots may have the ability to automate these attacks by initiating conversations with potential victims via phone calls and deceiving them into disclosing sensitive information. To validate this thesis, we introduce ViKing, an AI-powered vishing system developed using publicly available AI technology. It relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core cognitive processor to steer conversations with victims, complemented by a pipeline of speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules that facilitate audio-text conversion in phone calls.

However, cultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the misrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and the oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe consequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM for cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been a significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in this area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs in generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query tasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the knowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine both the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts. Using both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze the cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts. Our findings are concerning: over 65% of the generated texts exhibit notable cultural misalignments, with certain tasks demonstrating almost complete misalignment with key cultural values.

However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous resources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize global fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we propose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that enables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local trainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several heterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local trainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer importance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a Fisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm information. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the intrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA strategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into specific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck, and Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named Randomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with randomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both the dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy.

This paper presents a novel channel-native bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the catastrophic consequence of bit errors.

Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2505.15244v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "pubdate": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Mohamad Mestoukirdi, Mourad Khanfouci"}, {"title": "Foundations of Large Language Models", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09223", "description": "This is a book about large language models.

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2502.13509v2", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "pubdate": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "creator": "Shuai Niu, Jing Ma, Hongzhan Lin, Liang Bai, Zhihua Wang, Wei Bi, Yida Xu, Guo Li, Xian Yang"}, {"title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Vector Database: Storage and Retrieval Technique, Challenge", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11703", "description": "Vector databases (VDBs) have emerged to manage high-dimensional data that exceed the capabilities of traditional database management systems, and are now tightly integrated with large language models as well as widely applied in modern artificial intelligence systems. Although relatively few studies describe existing or introduce new vector database architectures, the core technologies underlying VDBs, such as approximate nearest neighbor search, have been extensively studied and are well documented in the literature. In this work, we present a comprehensive review of the relevant algorithms to provide a general understanding of this booming research area. Specifically, we first provide a review of storage and retrieval techniques in VDBs, with detailed design principles and technological evolution. Then, we conduct an in-depth comparison of several advanced VDB solutions with their strengths, limitations, and typical application scenarios. Finally, we also outline emerging opportunities for coupling VDBs with large language models, including open research problems and trends, such as novel indexing strategies. This survey aims to serve as a practical resource, enabling readers to quickly gain an overall understanding of the current knowledge landscape in this rapidly developing area.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2310.11703v2", "categories": ["cs.DB", "cs.AI"], "pubdate": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Le Ma, Ran Zhang, Yikun Han, Shirui Yu, Zaitian Wang, Zhiyuan Ning, Jinghan Zhang, Ping Xu, Pengjiang Li, Wei Ju, Chong Chen, Dongjie Wang, Kunpeng Liu, Pengyang Wang, Pengfei Wang, Yanjie Fu, Chunjiang Liu, Yuanchun Zhou, Chang-Tien Lu"}]
