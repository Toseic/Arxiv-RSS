The use of user diagrams to enhance federated recommendations is a promising topic. How to use user diagrams to enhance federated recommendations is a promising research topic. However, it's a great challenge to construct a user diagram without compromising privacy in a federated learning scenario. Inspired by the simple idea that similar users often have the same attribute characteristics, we propose a personalized federated recommendation algorithm based on the user relationship graph constructed by the user text characteristics(Graph Federation Recommendation System based on User Text description Features, UFGraphFR). The method uses the embedding layer weight of the user's text feature description to construct the user relationship graph.

In this scenario, each player tries to optimize their own utility function, which may not align with the collective goal. Within MpFL, we propose Per-Player Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (PEARL-SGD), an algorithm in which each player/client performs local updates independently and periodically communicates with other players.

This has implications for the analysis of rich, open-ended datasets, such as survey responses, where LLMs hold the promise of efficiently distilling key themes and sentiments. However, as organizations increasingly turn to these powerful AI systems to make sense of textual feedback, a critical question arises, can we trust LLMs to accurately represent the perspectives contained within these text based datasets? While LLMs excel at generating human-like summaries, there is a risk that their outputs may inadvertently diverge from the true substance of the original responses. Discrepancies between the LLM-generated outputs and the actual themes present in the data could lead to flawed decision-making, with far-reaching consequences for organizations. This research investigates the effectiveness of LLMs as judge models to evaluate the thematic alignment of summaries generated by other LLMs. We utilized an Anthropic Claude model to generate thematic summaries from open-ended survey responses, with Amazon's Titan Express, Nova Pro, and Meta's Llama serving as LLM judges. The LLM-as-judge approach was compared to human evaluations using Cohen's kappa, Spearman's rho, and Krippendorff's alpha, validating a scalable alternative to traditional human centric evaluation methods. Our findings reveal that while LLMs as judges offer a scalable solution comparable to human raters, humans may still excel at detecting subtle, context-specific nuances. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI assisted text analysis. We discuss limitations and provide recommendations for future research, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when generalizing LLM judge models across various contexts and use cases.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2501.08167v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 -0500", "announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Rewina Bedemariam, Natalie Perez, Sreyoshi Bhaduri, Satya Kapoor, Alex Gil, Elizabeth Conjar, Ikkei Itoku, David Theil, Aman Chadha, Naumaan Nayyar"}, {"title": "LLM Reading Tea Leaves: Automatically Evaluating Topic Models with Large Language Models", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09008", "description": "Topic modeling has been a widely used tool for unsupervised text analysis. However, comprehensive evaluations of a topic model remain challenging. Existing evaluation methods are either less comparable across different models (e.g., perplexity) or focus on only one specific aspect of a model (e.g., topic quality or document representation quality) at a time, which is insufficient to reflect the overall model performance. In this paper, we propose WALM (Word Agreement with Language Model), a new evaluation method for topic modeling that considers the semantic quality of document representations and topics in a joint manner, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). With extensive experiments involving different types of topic models, WALM is shown to align with human judgment and can serve as a complementary evaluation method to the existing ones, bringing a new perspective to topic modeling.

A common denominator for the metrics of trustworthiness is the quantification of uncertainty inherent in DL algorithms, and specifically in the model parameters, input data, and model predictions. One of the common approaches to address privacy-related issues in DL is to adopt distributed learning such as federated learning (FL), where private raw data is not shared among users. Despite the privacy-preserving mechanisms in FL, it still faces challenges in trustworthiness. Specifically, the malicious users, during training, can systematically create malicious model parameters to compromise the models predictive and generative capabilities, resulting in high uncertainty about their reliability. To demonstrate malicious behaviour, we propose a novel model poisoning attack method named Delphi which aims to maximise the uncertainty of the global model output. We achieve this by taking advantage of the relationship between the uncertainty and the model parameters of the first hidden layer of the local model. Delphi employs two types of optimisation , Bayesian Optimisation and Least Squares Trust Region, to search for the optimal poisoned model parameters, named as Delphi-BO and Delphi-LSTR. We quantify the uncertainty using the KL Divergence to minimise the distance of the predictive probability distribution towards an uncertain distribution of model output. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical proof for the attack effectiveness demonstrated in FL. Numerical results demonstrate that Delphi-BO induces a higher amount of uncertainty than Delphi-LSTR highlighting vulnerability of FL systems to model poisoning attacks.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2501.08002v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "pubdate": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:00:00 -0500", "announce_type": "cross", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Marios Aristodemou, Xiaolan Liu, Yuan Wang, Konstantinos G.
