More complex congenital malformations require a differentiated and multimodal decision-making process, usually including echocardiography as a central imaging method. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers considerable promise for clinicians by facilitating automated interpretation of pediatric echocardiography data. However, adapting AI technologies for pediatric echocardiography analysis has challenges such as limited public data availability, data privacy, and AI model transparency. Recently, researchers have focused on disruptive technologies, such as federated learning (FL) and explainable AI (XAI), to improve automatic diagnostic and decision support workflows. This study offers a comprehensive overview of the limitations and opportunities of AI in pediatric echocardiography, emphasizing the synergistic workflow and role of XAI and FL, identifying research gaps, and exploring potential future developments. Additionally, three relevant clinical use cases demonstrate the functionality of XAI and FL with a focus on (i) view recognition, (ii) disease classification, (iii) segmentation of cardiac structures, and (iv) quantitative assessment of cardiac function.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2411.10255v2", "categories": ["cs.AI"], "pubdate": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Mohammed Yaseen Jabarulla, Theodor Uden, Thomas Jack, Philipp Beerbaum, Steffen Oeltze-Jafra"}, {"title": "Route-and-Aggregate Decentralized Federated Learning Under Communication Errors", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22186", "description": "Decentralized federated learning (D-FL) allows clients to aggregate learning models locally, offering flexibility and scalability.

A recent study identifies the global weight shrinking effect in FL, indicating an enhancement in the global model's generalization when the sum of weights (i.e., the shrinking factor) is smaller than 1, where how to learn the shrinking factor becomes crucial. However, principled approaches to this solution have not been carefully studied from the adequate consideration of privacy concerns and layer-wise distinctions. To this end, we propose a novel model aggregation strategy, Federated Learning with Adaptive Layer-wise Weight Shrinking (FedLWS), which adaptively designs the shrinking factor in a layer-wise manner and avoids optimizing the shrinking factors on a proxy dataset. We initially explored the factors affecting the shrinking factor during the training process. Then we calculate the layer-wise shrinking factors by considering the distinctions among each layer of the global model. FedLWS can be easily incorporated with various existing methods due to its flexibility. Extensive experiments under diverse scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art approaches, providing a promising tool for enhancing the global model in FL.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2503.15111v2", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "pubdate": "Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Changlong Shi, Jinmeng Li, He Zhao, Dandan Guo, Yi Chang"}, {"title": "The Risks of Using Large Language Models for Text Annotation in Social Science Research", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22040", "description": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) or large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize computational social science, particularly in automated textual analysis.
