[{"title": "SAFL: Structure-Aware Personalized Federated Learning via Client-Specific Clustering and SCSI-Guided Model Pruning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18659", "description": "Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing local data, preserving privacy in diverse environments. While traditional FL approaches preserve privacy, they often struggle with high computational and communication overhead. To address these issues, model pruning is introduced as a strategy to streamline computations. However, existing pruning methods, when applied solely based on local data, often produce sub-models that inadequately reflect clients' specific tasks due to data insufficiency. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces SAFL (Structure-Aware Federated Learning), a novel framework that enhances personalized federated learning through client-specific clustering and Similar Client Structure Information (SCSI)-guided model pruning. SAFL employs a two-stage process: initially, it groups clients based on data similarities and uses aggregated pruning criteria to guide the pruning process, facilitating the identification of optimal sub-models. Subsequently, clients train these pruned models and engage in server-based aggregation, ensuring tailored and efficient models for each client. This method significantly reduces computational overhead while improving inference accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAFL markedly diminishes model size and improves performance, making it highly effective in federated environments characterized by heterogeneous data.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2501.18659v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.DC"], "pubdate": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500", "announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Nan Li, Xiaolu Wang, Xiao Du, Puyu Cai, Ting Wang"}, {"title": "Continuous-Time Analysis of Federated Averaging", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18870", "description": "Federated averaging (FedAvg) is a popular algorithm for horizontal federated learning (FL), where samples are gathered across different clients and are not shared with each other or a central server.

In personalized Federated Learning (pFL), clients train customized models to meet their personal objectives. However, due to the time-varying local data heterogeneity and the inaccessibility of previous data, existing pFL methods not only fail to solve the catastrophic forgetting of local models, but also difficult to estimate the degree of collaboration between clients. To address this issue, our core idea is a low consumption and high-quality generative replay architecture. Specifically, we decouple the generator by category to reduce the generation error of each category while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, use local model to improving the quality of generated data and reducing the update frequency of generator, and propose a local data reconstruction scheme to reduce data generation while adjusting the proportion of data categories. Based on above, we propose our pFL framework, pFedGRP, to achieve personalized aggregation and local knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets with multiple settings show the superiority of pFedGRP over eight baseline methods.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2410.01502v2", "categories": ["cs.DC"], "pubdate": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 -0500", "announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Sixing Tan, Xianmin Liu"}, {"title": "FedRTS: Federated Robust Pruning via Combinatorial Thompson Sampling", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19122", "description": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without data sharing, but its high computational and communication demands strain resource-constrained devices.
