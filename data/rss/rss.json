This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge from each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already undermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each client. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the central server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions or connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework, clients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other. After exchanging, each client treats both local and received head models as individual experts, and utilizes a client-specific Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to make collective decisions.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the \"overall truthfulness\" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as \"per-token\" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist \"generic truthful directions\" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces.

We started by learning the basics of Machine Learning, including the different types like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We also explored the important steps involved, such as preparing the data, choosing the right model, training it, and then checking its performance. Next, we examined some key challenges in Machine Learning, such as models learning too much from specific examples (overfitting), not learning enough (underfitting), and reflecting biases in the data used. Moving beyond centralized systems, we looked at decentralized Machine Learning and its benefits, like keeping data private, getting answers faster, and using a wider variety of data sources. We then focused on a specific type called federated learning, where models are trained without directly sharing sensitive information. Real-world examples from healthcare and finance were used to show how collaborative Machine Learning can solve important problems while still protecting information security.

In this paper, we attribute this competition to the homogeneity in loss patterns exhibited by rare and mislabeled data clients, preventing existing loss-based fair and robust FL methods from effectively distinguishing and handling these two distinct client types. To address this, we propose performance-capacity analysis, which jointly considers model performance on each client and its capacity to handle the dataset, measured by loss and a newly introduced feature dispersion score.

This issue also arises in federated learning, creating the need to address the federated unlearning problem. However, federated unlearning remains a challenging task. On the one hand, current research primarily focuses on unlearning all data from a client, overlooking more fine-grained unlearning targets, e.g., class-wise and sample-wise removal. On the other hand, existing methods suffer from imprecise estimation of data influence and impose significant computational or storage burden. To address these issues, we propose a neuro-inspired federated unlearning framework based on active forgetting, which is independent of model architectures and suitable for fine-grained unlearning targets. Our framework distinguishes itself from existing methods by utilizing new memories to overwrite old ones. These new memories are generated through teacher-student learning.

However, a large amount of data needed for enabling deep learning is stored on personal devices, and recent concerns on privacy have further highlighted challenges for accessing such data. As a result, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important privacy-preserving technology that enables collaborative training of machine learning models without the need to send the raw, potentially sensitive, data to a central server. However, the fundamental premise that sending model updates to a server is privacy-preserving only holds if the updates cannot be \"reverse engineered\" to infer information about the private training data. It has been shown under a wide variety of settings that this privacy premise does not hold. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive literature review of the different privacy attacks and defense methods in FL. We identify the current limitations of these attacks and highlight the settings in which the privacy of ann FL client can be broken.

The joint use of the multi-modal RS data can significantly enhance classification performance. To effectively exploit decentralized and unshared multi-modal RS data, our paper introduces a novel multi-modal FL framework for RS image classification problems. The proposed framework comprises three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3) mutual information maximization (MIM). The MF module employs iterative model averaging to facilitate learning without accessing multi-modal training data on clients. The FW module aims to address the limitations of training data heterogeneity by aligning data distributions across clients. The MIM module aims to model mutual information by maximizing the similarity between images from different modalities.

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively.
