[{"title": "Perfectly-Private Analog Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08683", "description": "In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models, secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem, but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2509.08683v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.IT", "math.IT"], "pubdate": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Delio Jaramillo-Velez, Charul Rajput, Ragnar Freij-Hollanti, Camilla Hollanti, Alexandre Graell i Amat"}, {"title": "MindVote: When AI Meets the Wild West of Social Media Opinion", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14422", "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scalable tools for pilot testing, predicting public opinion distributions before deploying costly surveys.

At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem, but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2509.08683v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.IT", "math.IT"], "pubdate": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Delio Jaramillo-Velez, Charul Rajput, Ragnar Freij-Hollanti, Camilla Hollanti, Alexandre Graell i Amat"}, {"title": "FedSSG: Expectation-Gated and History-Aware Drift Alignment for Federated Learning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13895", "description": "Non-IID data and partial participation induce client drift and inconsistent local optima in federated learning, causing unstable convergence and accuracy loss. We present FedSSG, a stochastic sampling-guided, history-aware drift alignment method. FedSSG maintains a per-client drift memory that accumulates local model differences as a lightweight sketch of historical gradients; crucially, it gates both the memory update and the local alignment term by a smooth function of the observed/expected participation ratio (a phase-by-expectation signal derived from the server sampler). This statistically grounded gate stays weak and smooth when sampling noise dominates early, then strengthens once participation statistics stabilize, contracting the local-global gap without extra communication. Across CIFAR-10/100 with 100/500 clients and 2-15 percent participation, FedSSG consistently outperforms strong drift-aware baselines and accelerates convergence; on our benchmarks it improves test accuracy by up to a few points (e.g., about +0.9 on CIFAR-10 and about +2.7 on CIFAR-100 on average over the top-2 baseline) and yields about 4.5x faster target-accuracy convergence on average. The method adds only O(d) client memory and a constant-time gate, and degrades gracefully to a mild regularizer under near-IID or uniform sampling. FedSSG shows that sampling statistics can be turned into a principled, history-aware phase control to stabilize and speed up federated training.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2509.13895v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "pubdate": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Zhanting Zhou, Jinshan Lai, Fengchun Zhang, Zeqin Wu, Fengli Zhang"}, {"title": "Differential Privacy in Federated Learning: Mitigating Inference Attacks with Randomized Response", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13987", "description": "Machine learning models used for distributed architectures consisting of servers and clients require large amounts of data to achieve high accuracy. Data obtained from clients are collected on a central server for model training. However, storing data on a central server raises concerns about security and privacy. To address this issue, a federated learning architecture has been proposed. In federated learning, each client trains a local model using its own data. The trained models are periodically transmitted to the central server. The server then combines the received models using federated aggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is distributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical manner. Although preventing data from leaving the clients enhances security, certain concerns still remain. Attackers can perform inference attacks on the obtained models to approximate the training dataset, potentially causing data leakage. In this study, differential privacy was applied to address the aforementioned security vulnerability, and a performance analysis was conducted. The Data-Unaware Classification Based on Association (duCBA) algorithm was used as the federated aggregation method. Differential privacy was implemented on the data using the Randomized Response technique, and the trade-off between security and performance was examined under different epsilon values. As the epsilon value decreased, the model accuracy declined, and class prediction imbalances were observed. This indicates that higher levels of privacy do not always lead to practical outcomes and that the balance between security and performance must be carefully considered.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2509.13987v1", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI"], "pubdate": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "cross", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Ozer Ozturk, Busra Buyuktanir, Gozde Karatas Baydogmus, Kazim Yildiz"}, {"title": "Designing AI-Agents with Personalities: A Psychometric Approach", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19238", "description": "We introduce a methodology for assigning quantifiable and psychometrically validated personalities to AI-Agents using the Big Five framework.

In Study 1, we show that large language models (LLMs) capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, providing a basis for personality assignment. In Study 2, we create AI-Agents using prompts designed based on the Big Five Inventory (BFI-2) in the Likert or Expanded format, and find that, when paired with newer LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek), these AI-Agents align more closely with human responses on the Mini-Markers test than those generated with binary adjective prompts or older models, although the finer pattern of results (e.g., factor loading patterns) were not consistent between AI-Agents and human participants. In Study 3, we validate our AI-Agents with risk-taking and moral dilemma vignettes. We find that while fine-tuning shifts responses toward more moral judgment, AI-Agent correlations between the input Big Five traits and the output moral judgments mirror those from human participants. Overall, our results show that AI-Agents align with humans in correlations between input Big Five traits and output responses and may serve as useful tools for preliminary research.

Specifically, the parameters of local models' shallow layers and typical local representations are both considered as shareable information for the server and are aggregated globally. To address performance degradation caused by label distribution skew among clients, contrastive learning is adopted between local and global representations to enrich local knowledge.

These systems also serve as components of dialogue, question-answering, and recommender systems. The trajectory of IR has evolved dynamically from its origins in term-based methods to its integration with advanced neural models. While the neural models excel at capturing complex contextual signals and semantic nuances, thereby reshaping the IR landscape, they still face challenges such as data scarcity, interpretability, and the generation of contextually plausible yet potentially inaccurate responses. This evolution requires a combination of both traditional methods (such as term-based sparse retrieval methods with rapid response) and modern neural architectures (such as language models with powerful language understanding capacity). Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), typified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized natural language processing due to their remarkable language understanding, generation, generalization, and reasoning abilities. Consequently, recent research has sought to leverage LLMs to improve IR systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research trajectory, it is necessary to consolidate existing methodologies and provide nuanced insights through a comprehensive overview. In this survey, we delve into the confluence of LLMs and IR systems, including crucial aspects such as query rewriters, retrievers, rerankers, and readers.
