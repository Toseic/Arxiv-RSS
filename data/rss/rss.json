In this paper, we investigate the decision-making and equilibrium behavior in federated learning systems, where agents choose between participating in global training or conducting independent local training. The problem is first modeled as a stage game and then extended to a repeated game to analyze the long-term dynamics of agent participation. For the stage game, we characterize the participation patterns and identify Nash equilibrium, revealing how data heterogeneity influences the equilibrium behavior-specifically, agents with similar data qualities will participate in FL as a group. We also derive the optimal social welfare and show that it coincides with Nash equilibrium under mild assumptions. In the repeated game, we propose a privacy-preserving, computationally efficient myopic strategy. This strategy enables agents to make practical decisions under bounded rationality and converges to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium of the stage game in finite time. By combining theoretical insights with practical strategy design, this work provides a realistic and effective framework for guiding and analyzing agent behaviors in federated learning systems.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2503.09039v1", "categories": ["cs.GT", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "pubdate": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Lihui Yi, Xiaochun Niu, Ermin Wei"}, {"title": "Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Educational Support: Leveraging Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction for Lesson Planning", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09276", "description": "Effective lesson planning is crucial in education process, serving as the cornerstone for high-quality teaching and the cultivation of a conducive learning atmosphere.

The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND ME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that retains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By serving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate context-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless communication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and interaction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME extends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory parameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning, and adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and intelligent approach to memory management.

However, we discover that using distilled local datasets can amplify the heterogeneity issue in FL. To address this, we propose Federated Learning on Virtual Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Dataset Distillation (FedLGD), where we seamlessly integrate dataset distillation algorithms into FL pipeline and train FL using a smaller synthetic dataset (referred as virtual data). Specifically, to harmonize the domain shifts, we propose iterative distribution matching to inpaint global information to local virtual data and use federated gradient matching to distill global virtual data that serve as anchor points to rectify heterogeneous local training, without compromising data privacy. We experiment on both benchmark and real-world datasets that contain heterogeneous data from different sources, and further scale up to an FL scenario that contains a large number of clients with heterogeneous and class-imbalanced data.

In this scenario, managing data and model heterogeneity among clients becomes a crucial problem, which poses a unique challenge that must be overcome: How can every client's local model learn generalizable representation in a decentralized manner? To address this challenge, we propose a novel Decentralized FL technique by introducing Synthetic Anchors, dubbed as DeSA. Based on the theory of domain adaptation and Knowledge Distillation (KD), we theoretically and empirically show that synthesizing global anchors based on raw data distribution facilitates mutual knowledge transfer. We further design two effective regularization terms for local training: 1) REG loss that regularizes the distribution of the client's latent embedding with the anchors and 2) KD loss that enables clients to learn from others.

We introduce QLLM, a novel inference system designed for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, featuring a fine-grained, priority-aware preemptive scheduler. QLLM enables expert-level preemption, deferring BE job execution while minimizing LS time-to-first-token (TTFT).

In PFL, models are trained to cater to specific feature distributions present in the population data. A notable method for PFL is the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), which mitigates the concerns associated with the non-IID-ness by grouping clients with similar data distributions. While it has been shown that IFCA enhances both accuracy and fairness, its strategy of dividing the population into smaller clusters increases vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), particularly among minorities with limited training samples. In this paper, we introduce IFCA-MIR, an improved version of IFCA that integrates MIA risk assessment into the clustering process.

This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair federated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this problem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g., training loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based on such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during testing, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence characteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address this limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose assessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed loss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive assessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to achieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the proposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time, progressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components in local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for each state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby improving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the well-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of FedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

However, we discover that using distilled local datasets can amplify the heterogeneity issue in FL. To address this, we propose Federated Learning on Virtual Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Dataset Distillation (FedLGD), where we seamlessly integrate dataset distillation algorithms into FL pipeline and train FL using a smaller synthetic dataset (referred as virtual data). Specifically, to harmonize the domain shifts, we propose iterative distribution matching to inpaint global information to local virtual data and use federated gradient matching to distill global virtual data that serve as anchor points to rectify heterogeneous local training, without compromising data privacy.

In this scenario, managing data and model heterogeneity among clients becomes a crucial problem, which poses a unique challenge that must be overcome: How can every client's local model learn generalizable representation in a decentralized manner? To address this challenge, we propose a novel Decentralized FL technique by introducing Synthetic Anchors, dubbed as DeSA. Based on the theory of domain adaptation and Knowledge Distillation (KD), we theoretically and empirically show that synthesizing global anchors based on raw data distribution facilitates mutual knowledge transfer.

The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''.

This raises significant fairness concerns. Existing fair federated learning methods have demonstrated some effectiveness in solving this problem by aligning a single 0th- or 1st-order state of convergence (e.g., training loss or sharpness). However, we argue in this work that fairness based on such a single state is still not an adequate surrogate for fairness during testing, as these single metrics fail to fully capture the convergence characteristics, making them suboptimal for guiding fair learning. To address this limitation, we develop a generalized framework. Specifically, we propose assessing convergence using multiple states, defined as sharpness or perturbed loss computed at varying search distances. Building on this comprehensive assessment, we propose promoting fairness for these states across clients to achieve our ultimate fairness objective. This is accomplished through the proposed method, FedISM+. In FedISM+, the search distance evolves over time, progressively focusing on different states. We then incorporate two components in local training and global aggregation to ensure cross-client fairness for each state. This gradually makes convergence equitable for all states, thereby improving fairness during testing. Our empirical evaluations, performed on the well-known RSNA ICH and ISIC 2019 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of FedISM+ over existing state-of-the-art methods for fair federated learning.

To address these issues, we propose PRISM, a FL framework tailored for generative models that ensures (i) stable performance in heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) resource efficiency in terms of communication cost and final model size. The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic binary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights, identifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a ``strong lottery ticket''. By communicating binary masks in a stochastic manner, PRISM minimizes communication overhead. This approach, combined with the utilization of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss and a mask-aware dynamic moving average aggregation method (MADA) on the server side, facilitates stable and strong generative capabilities by mitigating local divergence in FL scenarios. Moreover, thanks to its sparsifying characteristic, PRISM yields a lightweight model without extra pruning or quantization, making it ideal for environments such as edge devices. Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR10 demonstrate that PRISM outperforms existing methods, while maintaining privacy with minimal communication costs. PRISM is the first to successfully generate images under challenging non-IID and privacy-preserving FL environments on complex datasets, where previous methods have struggled.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2503.08085v2", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CR", "cs.CV"], "pubdate": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Kyeongkook Seo, Dong-Jun Han, Jaejun Yoo"}]
