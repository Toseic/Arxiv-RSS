[{"title": "From Street Views to Urban Science: Discovering Road Safety Factors with Multimodal Large Language Models", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02242", "description": "Urban and transportation research has long sought to uncover statistically meaningful relationships between key variables and societal outcomes such as road safety, to generate actionable insights that guide the planning, development, and renewal of urban and transportation systems. However, traditional workflows face several key challenges: (1) reliance on human experts to propose hypotheses, which is time-consuming and prone to confirmation bias; (2) limited interpretability, particularly in deep learning approaches; and (3) underutilization of unstructured data that can encode critical urban context. Given these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approach for interpretable hypothesis inference, enabling the automated generation, evaluation, and refinement of hypotheses concerning urban context and road safety outcomes. Our method leverages MLLMs to craft safety-relevant questions for street view images (SVIs), extract interpretable embeddings from their responses, and apply them in regression-based statistical models. UrbanX supports iterative hypothesis testing and refinement, guided by statistical evidence such as coefficient significance, thereby enabling rigorous scientific discovery of previously overlooked correlations between urban design and safety. Experimental evaluations on Manhattan street segments demonstrate that our approach outperforms pretrained deep learning models while offering full interpretability. Beyond road safety, UrbanX can serve as a general-purpose framework for urban scientific discovery, extracting structured insights from unstructured urban data across diverse socioeconomic and environmental outcomes. This approach enhances model trustworthiness for policy applications and establishes a scalable, statistically grounded pathway for interpretable knowledge discovery in urban and transportation studies.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2506.02242v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.CY"], "pubdate": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Yihong Tang, Ao Qu, Xujing Yu, Weipeng Deng, Jun Ma, Jinhua Zhao, Lijun Sun"}, {"title": "FORLA:Federated Object-centric Representation Learning with Slot Attention", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02964", "description": "Learning efficient visual representations across heterogeneous unlabeled datasets remains a central challenge in federated learning. Effective federated representations require features that are jointly informative across clients while disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision.

At the core of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across clients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention module that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this adapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a student decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models, while a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional counterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by aligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple real-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized baselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal representation that generalizes well across domains.

We present MorphServe, a dynamic, workload-aware LLM serving framework based on morphological adaptation. MorphServe introduces two asynchronous, token-level runtime mechanisms: quantized layer swapping, which selectively replaces less impactful layers with quantized alternatives during high-load periods, and pressure-aware KV cache resizing, which dynamically adjusts KV cache capacity in response to memory pressure. These mechanisms enable state-preserving transitions with minimum runtime overhead and are fully compatible with modern scheduling and attention techniques.

However, current approaches like co-deploying FP8 and FP16 models suffer from increased storage overhead and fail to unlock FP8's full potential. To address these limitations, we introduce NestedFP, a novel precision-adaptive serving technique enabling seamless FP8 and FP16 inference from a single 16-bit model representation, thereby incurring no additional memory cost. NestedFP decomposes each FP16 weight into two 8-bit components, facilitating efficient FP8 execution while preserving full FP16 accuracy. We demonstrate the practical viability of our approach by implementing a custom CUTLASS-based GEMM kernel that reconstructs FP16 operands on-the-fly, integrated within the vLLM serving framework. Our evaluation shows that NestedFP delivers up to 1.55x throughput improvement in FP8 mode with negligible accuracy degradation compared to FP16 precision, while introducing only 3.9% performance overhead on average in FP16 mode across various models.

Despite various communication-efficient strategies, the intrinsic dimension-dependent communication cost remains a major bottleneck for current FL implementations. This paper proposes a novel dimension-free communication algorithm - DeComFL, which leverages the zeroth-order optimization techniques and reduces the communication cost from $\\mathscr{O}(d)$ to $\\mathscr{O}(1)$ by transmitting only a constant number of scalar values between clients and the server in each round, regardless of the dimension $d$ of the model parameters.

However, many applications of dueling bandits involve multiple agents who wish to collaborate for improved performance yet are unwilling to share their data. This motivates us to draw inspirations from federated learning, which involves multiple agents aiming to collaboratively train their neural networks via gradient descent (GD) without sharing their raw data. Previous works have developed federated linear bandit algorithms which rely on closed-form updates of the bandit parameters (e.g., the linear function parameters) to achieve collaboration. However, in linear dueling bandits, the linear function parameters lack a closed-form expression and their estimation requires minimizing a loss function.

Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights.

(2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining.

However, this approach conflates self-preference bias with response quality, as higher-quality responses from the judge model may also lead to positive score differences, even in the absence of bias.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes A$^2$ATS, a novel retrieval-based KV cache reduction method. A$^2$ATS aims to obtain an accurate approximation of attention scores by applying the vector quantization technique to key states, thereby enabling efficient and precise retrieval of the top-K tokens.

Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining.

This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2502.05206v4", "categories": ["cs.CR", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.CV"], "pubdate": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Xingjun Ma, Yifeng Gao, Yixu Wang, Ruofan Wang, Xin Wang, Ye Sun, Yifan Ding, Hengyuan Xu, Yunhao Chen, Yunhan Zhao, Hanxun Huang, Yige Li, Jiaming Zhang, Xiang Zheng, Yang Bai, Zuxuan Wu, Xipeng Qiu, Jingfeng Zhang, Yiming Li, Xudong Han, Haonan Li, Jun Sun, Cong Wang, Jindong Gu, Baoyuan Wu, Siheng Chen, Tianwei Zhang, Yang Liu, Mingming Gong, Tongliang Liu, Shirui Pan, Cihang Xie, Tianyu Pang, Yinpeng Dong, Ruoxi Jia, Yang Zhang, Shiqing Ma, Xiangyu Zhang, Neil Gong, Chaowei Xiao, Sarah Erfani, Tim Baldwin, Bo Li, Masashi Sugiyama, Dacheng Tao, James Bailey, Yu-Gang Jiang"}, {"title": "A Survey of LLM $\\times$ DATA", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18458", "description": "The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2505.18458v3", "categories": ["cs.DB", "cs.AI", "cs.CL", "cs.IR", "cs.LG"], "pubdate": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace-cross", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Xuanhe Zhou, Junxuan He, Wei Zhou, Haodong Chen, Zirui Tang, Haoyu Zhao, Xin Tong, Guoliang Li, Youmin Chen, Jun Zhou, Zhaojun Sun, Binyuan Hui, Shuo Wang, Conghui He, Zhiyuan Liu, Jingren Zhou, Fan Wu"}, {"title": "Computation- and Communication-Efficient Online FL for Resource-Constrained Aerial Vehicles", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02972", "description": "Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning (ML) and aerial connected vehicle (ACV)-assisted edge computing have drawn significant attention lately. Since the onboard sensors of ACVs can capture new data as they move along their trajectories, the continual arrival of such 'newly' sensed data leads to online learning and demands carefully crafting the trajectories. Besides, as typical ACVs are inherently resource-constrained, computation- and communication-efficient ML solutions are needed. Therefore, we propose a computation- and communication-efficient online aerial federated learning (2CEOAFL) algorithm to take the benefits of continual sensed data and limited onboard resources of the ACVs. In particular, considering independently owned ACVs act as selfish data collectors, we first model their trajectories according to their respective time-varying data distributions. We then propose a 2CEOAFL algorithm that allows the flying ACVs to (a) prune the received dense ML model to make it shallow, (b) train the pruned model, and (c) probabilistically quantize and offload their trained accumulated gradients to the central server (CS). Our extensive simulation results show that the proposed 2CEOAFL algorithm delivers comparable performances to its non-pruned and nonquantized, hence, computation- and communication-inefficient counterparts.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2506.02972v1", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.NI", "cs.SY", "eess.SY"], "pubdate": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "cross", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Md-Ferdous Pervej, Richeng Jin, Md Moin Uddin Chowdhury, Simran Singh, \\.Ismail G\\\"uven\\c{c}, Huaiyu Dai"}, {"title": "An AI-powered Public Health Automated Kiosk System for Personalized Care: An Experimental Pilot Study", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13880", "description": "Background: The HERMES Kiosk (Healthcare Enhanced Recommendations through Artificial Intelligence & Expertise System) is designed to provide personalized Over-the-Counter (OTC) medication recommendations, addressing the limitations of traditional health kiosks. It integrates an advanced GAMENet model enhanced with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Multi-Head Cross-Attention (MHCA) while ensuring user privacy through federated learning. This paper outlines the conceptual design and architecture of HERMES, with a focus on deployment in high-traffic public areas. Methods: HERMES analyzes self-reported symptoms and anonymized medical histories using AI algorithms to generate context-aware OTC medication recommendations. The system was initially trained using Electronic Health Records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset (6,350 patients) and Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) data from the TWOSIDES database, incorporating the top 90 severity DDI types. Real-time DDI checks and ATC-mapped drug codes further improve safety. The kiosk is designed for accessibility, offering multilingual support, large fonts, voice commands, and Braille compatibility. A built-in health education library promotes preventive care and health literacy. A survey was conducted among 10 medical professionals to evaluate its potential applications in medicine. Results: Preliminary results show that the enhanced GAMENet model achieved a Precision-Recall AUC (PRAUC) of 0.74, outperforming the original model. These findings suggest a strong potential for delivering accurate and secure healthcare recommendations in public settings. Conclusion: HERMES demonstrates how AI-driven, privacy-preserving kiosks can enhance public health access, empower users, and alleviate burdens on healthcare systems. Future work will focus on real-world deployment, usability testing, and scalability for broader adoption.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2504.13880v2", "categories": ["cs.HC"], "pubdate": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 00:00:00 -0400", "announce_type": "replace", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "creator": "Sonya Falahati, Morteza Alizadeh, Fatemeh Ghazipour, Zhino Safahi, Navid Khaledian, Mohammad R.
