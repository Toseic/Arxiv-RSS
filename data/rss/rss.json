However, bias in LLMs may occur not only explicitly, but also implicitly, much like humans who consciously strive for impartiality yet still harbor implicit bias. The unconscious and automatic nature of implicit bias makes it particularly challenging to study. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on implicit bias in LLMs. We begin by introducing key concepts, theories and methods related to implicit bias in psychology, extending them from humans to LLMs. Drawing on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and other psychological frameworks, we categorize detection methods into three primary approaches: word association, task-oriented text generation and decision-making. We divide our taxonomy of evaluation metrics for implicit bias into two categories: single-value-based metrics and comparison-value-based metrics. We classify datasets into two types: sentences with masked tokens and complete sentences, incorporating datasets from various domains to reflect the broad application of LLMs. Although research on mitigating implicit bias in LLMs is still limited, we summarize existing efforts and offer insights on future challenges.

This shift has led to the need for models offering varying privacy guarantees and utility levels to satisfy diverse user requirements. However, managing numerous versions of large models introduces significant operational challenges, including increased inference latency, higher resource consumption, and elevated costs. Model deduplication is a technique widely used by many model serving and database systems to support high-performance and low-cost inference queries and model diagnosis queries. However, none of the existing model deduplication works has considered privacy, leading to unbounded aggregation of privacy costs for certain deduplicated models and inefficiencies when applied to deduplicate DP-trained models. We formalize the problems of deduplicating DP-trained models for the first time and propose a novel privacy- and accuracy-aware deduplication mechanism to address the problems. We developed a greedy strategy to select and assign base models to target models to minimize storage and privacy costs. When deduplicating a target model, we dynamically schedule accuracy validations and apply the Sparse Vector Technique to reduce the privacy costs associated with private validation data. Compared to baselines that do not provide privacy guarantees, our approach improved the compression ratio by up to $35\\times$ for individual models (including large language models and vision transformers).

Therefore, we propose a novel approach integrating Federated Learning (FL) into FF control to address these challenges. This approach enables privacy-preserving, communication-efficient, and decentralized continuous improvement of FF controllers across multiple agents without sharing personal or proprietary data. By leveraging FL, each agent learns a local, neural FF controller using its data and contributes only model updates to a global aggregation process, ensuring data privacy and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an autonomous driving use case. Therein, vehicles equipped with a trajectory-tracking feedback controller are enhanced by FL-based neural FF control. Simulations highlight significant improvements in tracking performance compared to pure FB control, analogous to model-based FF control.

In intelligent enterprises, machine learning based models are adopted to extract insights from data. Due to the efficiency and privacy challenges of these traditional models, a new federated learning (FL) paradigm has emerged. In FL, multiple enterprises can jointly train a model to update a final model. However, firstly, FL trained models usually perform worse than centralized models, especially when enterprises training data is non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed). Second, due to the centrality of FL and the untrustworthiness of local enterprises, traditional FL solutions are vulnerable to poisoning and inference attacks and violate privacy. Thirdly, the continuous transfer of parameters between enterprises and servers increases communication costs. To this end, the FedAnil+ model is proposed, a novel, lightweight, and secure Federated Deep Learning Model that includes three main phases. In the first phase, the goal is to solve the data type distribution skew challenge. Addressing privacy concerns against poisoning and inference attacks is covered in the second phase. Finally, to alleviate the communication overhead, a novel compression approach is proposed that significantly reduces the size of the updates. The experiment results validate that FedAnil+ is secure against inference and poisoning attacks with better accuracy.

However, bias in LLMs may occur not only explicitly, but also implicitly, much like humans who consciously strive for impartiality yet still harbor implicit bias. The unconscious and automatic nature of implicit bias makes it particularly challenging to study. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on implicit bias in LLMs. We begin by introducing key concepts, theories and methods related to implicit bias in psychology, extending them from humans to LLMs. Drawing on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and other psychological frameworks, we categorize detection methods into three primary approaches: word association, task-oriented text generation and decision-making. We divide our taxonomy of evaluation metrics for implicit bias into two categories: single-value-based metrics and comparison-value-based metrics. We classify datasets into two types: sentences with masked tokens and complete sentences, incorporating datasets from various domains to reflect the broad application of LLMs. Although research on mitigating implicit bias in LLMs is still limited, we summarize existing efforts and offer insights on future challenges. We aim for this work to serve as a clear guide for researchers and inspire innovative ideas to advance exploration in this task.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2503.02776v1", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "pubdate": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0500", "announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "creator": "Xinru Lin, Luyang Li"}, {"title": "Mask-DPO: Generalizable Fine-grained Factuality Alignment of LLMs", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02846", "description": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains. Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training. Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO. Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training. Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%. We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions. We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it. We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment.", "guid": "oai:arXiv.org:2503.02846v1", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "pubdate": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0500", "announce_type": "new", "rights": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "creator": "Yuzhe Gu, Wenwei Zhang, Chengqi Lyu, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen"}, {"title": "Vision Language Models in Medicine", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01863", "description": "With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), medical artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced significant technological progress and paradigm shifts.

However, so far it has been used primarily in a centralized approach where the data collected from hospitals are stored in one center and used to train the nnU-Net. This centralized approach has various limitations, such as leakage of sensitive patient information and violation of patient privacy. Federated learning is one of the approaches to train a segmentation model in a decentralized manner that helps preserve patient privacy. In this paper, we propose FednnU-Net, a federated learning extension of nnU-Net. We introduce two novel federated learning methods to the nnU-Net framework - Federated Fingerprint Extraction (FFE) and Asymmetric Federated Averaging (AsymFedAvg) - and experimentally show their consistent performance for breast, cardiac and fetal segmentation using 6 datasets representing samples from 18 institutions. Additionally, to further promote research and deployment of decentralized training in privacy constrained institutions, we make our plug-n-play framework public.
